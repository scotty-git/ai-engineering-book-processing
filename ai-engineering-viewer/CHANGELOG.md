## Development Journey

### The Challenge
Started with a complex type system that caused numerous import errors and build failures. The original approach used external type definitions that created circular dependencies and module resolution issues.

### The Solution
Implemented a "nuclear option" approach:
1. Removed all external type dependencies
2. Used inline TypeScript interfaces in each component
3. Simplified the architecture for reliability
4. Prioritized working code over complex abstractions

### Lessons Learned
- Sometimes simpler solutions are more robust
- Type safety doesn't require complex hierarchies
- Developer experience matters more than perfect architecture
- Working code is better than perfect code that doesn't work

### Key Decisions
- **React 17 over 18**: Chose stability over latest features
- **Inline types**: Chose simplicity over reusability
- **Single directory**: Chose clarity over nested organization
- **CSS Modules**: Chose scoped styles over global CSS

This changelog will be updated with each release to track the evolution of the project.
