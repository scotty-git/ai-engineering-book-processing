To illustrate this, here are two examples, one with only the final answer and one with CoT. Both are from Chun et al. (2024):\nInstruction: Please answer the following question.

However, a model’s tool use ability can be improved by showing it tool use examples. It’s common to use domain experts to create tool use data, where each prompt is a task that requires tool use, and its response is the actions needed to perform that task. For example, if you want data to finetune a model to act as a personal assistant, you might want to ask professional personal assistants what types of tasks they usually perform, how they perform them, and what tools they need. If you ask human experts to explain how they do things, they might miss certain steps, either because of faulty memory or because they might think these steps aren’t important. It’s often necessary to observe how humans perform these tasks to ensure accuracy.\nHowever, what’s efficient for humans might not be efficient for AI, and vice versa. As a result, human annotations might not be ideal for AI agents. For example, a human might prefer a web interface, whereas it’s easier for a model to use an API. To search for something, a human might first open a browser, copy and paste that query into the search bar, and click on each result. Meanwhile, a model can just send a request to the search API with the query and process all the results at once. For this reason, many rely on simulations and other synthetic techniques to generate tool use data, as explored later in this chapter.\nTool use data might also require special formats. In typical conversation data, the user and AI take turns, with each turn containing one message. However, for tool use, the AI might need to generate multiple messages each turn, with each message sent to a different location. For example, it might send one message to the code interpreter and one message to the user (such as to inform the user what it’s doing). To support this, Llama 3 authors (Dubey et al., 2024) designed a multi-message chat format that consists of message headers that specify the source and destination of each message, and special termination tokens to specify where the human and AI turns start."
