## 5-Phase Methodology (Apply to Each Micro-Task)

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
1. Extract exact lines from full-book-messy.md for range 2795-3300
2. Validate extraction completeness
3. Create working reference for your sections

### Phase 2: Text Cleaning
1. Remove page numbers and PDF artifacts
2. Fix broken hyphens and technical terms
3. Normalize spacing and paragraph breaks
4. Handle footnote markers and references
5. Preserve technical process descriptions

### Phase 3: Structure Analysis
1. Identify all headings and process sections
2. Map technical content types (workflows, examples, formulas)
3. Note special formatting requirements for training content
4. Plan Markdown structure for complex processes

### Phase 4: Markdown Formatting
1. Apply proper heading hierarchy
2. Format training content:
   - Workflow diagrams as italicized placeholders
   - Example tables with proper Markdown format
   - Mathematical formulas with clear notation
   - Process descriptions with logical flow
3. Handle technical terminology consistently
4. Maintain professional presentation

### Phase 5: Quality Validation
1. Verify training process accuracy
2. Check example data formatting
3. Validate mathematical notation
4. Ensure technical process clarity
5. Collect footnotes for final assembly

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] All assigned sections (lines 2795-3300) processed using 5-phase methodology
- [ ] Quality standards validation passed
- [ ] Training workflow diagrams referenced properly
- [ ] Example tables formatted correctly in Markdown
- [ ] Mathematical notation preserved accurately
- [ ] Complex processes clearly presented
- [ ] Footnotes collected and noted for consolidation
- [ ] Output file created: `chapter-02-agent-c-output.md`
- [ ] No user intervention required during processing
- [ ] Technical training accuracy maintained

## Deliverables
1. **Processed sections** in clean Markdown format
2. **Output file**: chapter-02-agent-c-output.md
3. **Footnote collection** - list of all footnotes found in your sections
4. **Quality validation report** - confirmation of standards compliance
5. **Processing notes** - any training process issues or special cases

## Autonomous Execution Instructions
1. Work through each micro-task systematically
2. Apply the 5-phase methodology to each section
3. Pay special attention to training process accuracy
4. Use Chapter 1 as your formatting reference
5. Complete all tasks without requesting user confirmation
6. Validate training content at each phase
7. Create final output file with all sections combined
8. Document any process issues for assembly review

## Quality Reference
Use chapter-01-introduction-to-building-ai-applications-with-foundation-models.md as your formatting template. Match:
- Technical process formatting
- Example data presentation
- Mathematical notation handling
- Workflow description format
- Professional technical presentation

## Coordination Notes
- Work independently on your assigned sections only
- Note any cross-references to other agents' sections
- Collect footnotes separately for final consolidation
- Document any training process formatting decisions
- Complete work autonomously without user intervention
