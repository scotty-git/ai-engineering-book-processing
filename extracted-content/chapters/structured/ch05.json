Many smart people pondered at length why and how in-context learning works (see “How Does In-context Learning Work?” by the Stanford AI Lab). François Chollet, the creator of the ML framework Keras, compared a foundation model to a library of many different programs. For example, it might contain one program that can write haikus and another that can write limericks. Each program can be activated by certain prompts. In this view, prompt engineering is about finding the right prompt that can activate the program you want.",
      "raw_html": "<p class=\"pagebreak-before\">Today, in-context learning is taken for granted. A foundation model learns from a massive amount of data and should be able to do a lot of things. However, before GPT-3, ML models could do only what they were trained to do, so in-context learning felt like magic.
