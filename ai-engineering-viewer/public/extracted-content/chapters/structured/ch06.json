The simplest method is to split the query into words, treating each word as a separate term. However, this can lead to multi-word terms being broken into individual words, losing their original meaning. For example, “hot dog” would be split into “hot” and “dog”. When this happens, neither retains the meaning of the original term. One way to mitigate this issue is to treat the most common n-grams as terms.

Originally developed to overcome a model’s context limitations, RAG also enables more efficient use of information, improving response quality while reducing costs. From the early days of foundation models, it was clear that the RAG pattern would be immensely valuable for a wide range of applications, and it has since been rapidly adopted across both consumer and enterprise use cases.</p>",
