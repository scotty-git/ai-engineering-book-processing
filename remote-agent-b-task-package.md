## 5-Phase Methodology (Apply to Each Micro-Task)

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
1. Extract exact lines from full-book-messy.md for range 2386-2794
2. Validate extraction completeness
3. Create working reference for your sections

### Phase 2: Text Cleaning
1. Remove page numbers and PDF artifacts
2. Fix broken hyphens and technical terms
3. Normalize spacing and paragraph breaks
4. Handle footnote markers and references
5. Preserve mathematical notation integrity

### Phase 3: Structure Analysis
1. Identify all headings and technical sections
2. Map technical content types (formulas, diagrams, comparisons)
3. Note special formatting requirements for technical content
4. Plan Markdown structure for complex technical material

### Phase 4: Markdown Formatting
1. Apply proper heading hierarchy
2. Format technical content:
   - Mathematical formulas with proper notation
   - Technical diagrams as italicized placeholders
   - Architecture comparisons in clear format
   - Code examples with proper blocks
3. Handle technical terminology with backticks
4. Maintain professional technical presentation

### Phase 5: Quality Validation
1. Verify technical accuracy preserved
2. Check mathematical notation formatting
3. Validate technical terminology consistency
4. Ensure professional technical readability
5. Collect footnotes for final assembly

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] All assigned sections (lines 2386-2794) processed using 5-phase methodology
- [ ] Quality standards validation passed
- [ ] Mathematical formulas properly formatted
- [ ] Technical diagrams referenced with italicized placeholders
- [ ] Architecture comparisons clearly presented
- [ ] Memory calculations accurately preserved
- [ ] Footnotes collected and noted for consolidation
- [ ] Output file created: `chapter-02-agent-b-output.md`
- [ ] No user intervention required during processing
- [ ] Technical accuracy maintained throughout

## Deliverables
1. **Processed sections** in clean Markdown format
2. **Output file**: chapter-02-agent-b-output.md
3. **Footnote collection** - list of all footnotes found in your sections
4. **Quality validation report** - confirmation of standards compliance
5. **Processing notes** - any technical issues or special cases encountered

## Autonomous Execution Instructions
1. Work through each micro-task systematically
2. Apply the 5-phase methodology to each section
3. Pay special attention to technical accuracy
4. Use Chapter 1 as your formatting reference
5. Complete all tasks without requesting user confirmation
6. Validate technical content at each phase
7. Create final output file with all sections combined
8. Document any technical issues for assembly review

## Quality Reference
Use chapter-01-introduction-to-building-ai-applications-with-foundation-models.md as your formatting template. Match:
- Technical content formatting
- Mathematical notation handling
- Figure reference format
- Technical term presentation
- Professional technical presentation

## Coordination Notes
- Work independently on your assigned sections only
- Note any cross-references to other agents' sections
- Collect footnotes separately for final consolidation
- Document any technical formatting decisions
- Complete work autonomously without user intervention
