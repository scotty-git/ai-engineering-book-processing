- Preserve figure numbering and references

### Technical Content
- Preserve all technical terms exactly
- Maintain numerical data and statistics
- Keep code examples with proper formatting
- Use backticks for technical terms and APIs

## 5-Phase Methodology (Apply to Each Micro-Task)

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
1. Extract exact lines from full-book-messy.md for your assigned range
2. Validate extraction completeness
3. Create working reference for your sections

### Phase 2: Text Cleaning
1. Remove page numbers (format: "X | Chapter Y: Title")
2. Fix broken hyphens (rejoin words split with "‚Äê" character)
3. Normalize spacing and paragraph breaks
4. Handle footnote markers and references
5. Remove extra whitespace and formatting artifacts

### Phase 3: Structure Analysis
1. Identify all headings (H1, H2, H3, H4) with exact hierarchy
2. Map content types (paragraphs, tables, lists, figures)
3. Note special formatting requirements
4. Plan Markdown structure

### Phase 4: Markdown Formatting
1. Apply proper heading hierarchy:
   - H1: Chapter title only
   - H2: Major sections
   - H3: Subsections
   - H4: Sub-subsections
2. Format content elements:
   - Double line breaks between paragraphs
   - Proper table formatting
   - Code blocks with triple backticks
   - Lists with consistent formatting
3. Handle special elements (figures, footnotes, technical terms)

### Phase 5: Quality Validation
1. Check heading hierarchy (no skipped levels)
2. Verify all content preserved
3. Validate Markdown syntax
4. Ensure professional readability
5. Collect footnotes for final assembly

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] All assigned sections (lines 2119-2385) processed using 5-phase methodology
- [ ] Quality standards validation passed
- [ ] Tables properly formatted in Markdown
- [ ] Figure references maintained with italicized placeholders
- [ ] Footnotes collected and noted for consolidation
- [ ] Output file created: `chapter-02-agent-a-output.md`
- [ ] No user intervention required during processing
- [ ] Professional readability maintained throughout
- [ ] All technical content preserved accurately

## Deliverables
1. **Processed sections** in clean Markdown format
2. **Output file**: chapter-02-agent-a-output.md
3. **Footnote collection** - list of all footnotes found in your sections
4. **Quality validation report** - confirmation of standards compliance
5. **Processing notes** - any issues or special cases encountered

## Autonomous Execution Instructions
1. Work through each micro-task systematically
2. Apply the 5-phase methodology to each section
3. Use Chapter 1 as your formatting reference
4. Complete all tasks without requesting user confirmation
5. Validate quality at each phase
6. Create final output file with all sections combined
7. Document any issues or special cases for assembly review

## Quality Reference
Use chapter-01-introduction-to-building-ai-applications-with-foundation-models.md as your formatting template. Match:
- Heading hierarchy and formatting
- Paragraph spacing (double line breaks)
- Table formatting style
- Figure reference format
- Technical term handling
- Overall professional presentation

## Coordination Notes
- Work independently on your assigned sections only
- Note any cross-references to other agents' sections
- Collect footnotes separately for final consolidation
- Document any ambiguous formatting decisions
- Complete work autonomously without user intervention
