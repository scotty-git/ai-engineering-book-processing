<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>Understanding Foundation Models</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html0"/>To build applications with foundation models, you first need foundation models. While you don’t need to know how to develop a model to use it, a high-level understanding will help you decide what model to use and how to adapt it to your needs.</p>

<p>Training a foundation model is an incredibly complex and costly process. Those who know how to do this well are likely prevented by confidentiality agreements from disclosing the secret sauce. This chapter won’t be able to tell you how to build a model to compete with ChatGPT. Instead, I’ll focus on design decisions with consequential impact on downstream applications.</p>

<p>With the growing lack of transparency in the training process of foundation models, it’s difficult to know all the design decisions that go into making a model. In general, however, differences in foundation models can be traced back to decisions about training data, model architecture and size, and how they are post-trained to align with human preferences.</p>

<p>Since models learn from data, their training data reveals a great deal about their capabilities and limitations. This chapter begins with how model developers curate training data, focusing on the distribution of training data. <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a> explores dataset engineering techniques in detail, including data quality evaluation and data synthesis.</p>

<p>Given the dominance of the transformer architecture, it might seem that model architecture is less of a choice. You might be wondering, what makes the transformer architecture so special that it continues to dominate? How long until another architecture takes over, and what might this new architecture look like? This chapter will address all of these questions. Whenever a new model is released, one of the first things people want to know is its size. This chapter will also explore how a model developer might determine the appropriate size for their model.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_building_ai_applications_with_foun_1730130814984319">Chapter 1</a>, a model’s training process is often divided into pre-training and post-training. Pre-training makes a model capable, but not necessarily safe or easy to use. This is where post-training comes in. The goal of post-training is to align the model with human preferences. But what exactly is <em>human preference</em>? How can it be represented in a way that a model can learn? The way a model developer aligns their model has a significant impact on the model’s usability, and will be discussed in this chapter.</p>

<p>While most people understand the impact of training on a model’s performance, the impact of <em>sampling</em> is often overlooked. Sampling is how a model chooses an output from all possible options. It is perhaps one of the most underrated concepts in AI. Not only does sampling explain many seemingly baffling AI behaviors, including hallucinations and inconsistencies, but choosing the right sampling strategy can also significantly boost a model’s performance with relatively little effort. For this reason, sampling is the section that I was the most excited to write about in this chapter.</p>

<p>Concepts covered in this chapter are fundamental for understanding the rest of the book. However, because these concepts are fundamental, you might already be familiar with them. Feel free free to skip any concept that you’re confident about. If you encounter a confusing concept later on, you can revisit this chapter.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Training Data"><div class="sect1" id="ch02_training_data_1730147895571606">
<h1>Training Data</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="training data" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html1"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="training data" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html2"/>An AI model is only as good as the data it was trained on. If there’s no Vietnamese in the training data, the model won’t be able to translate from English into Vietnamese. Similarly, if an image classification model sees only animals in its training set, it won’t perform well on photos of plants.</p>

<p>If you want a model to improve on a certain task, you might want to include more data for that task in the training data. However, collecting sufficient data for training a large model isn’t easy, and it can be expensive. Model developers often have to rely on available data, even if this data doesn’t exactly meet their needs.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Common Crawl dataset" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html3"/>For example, a common source for training data is <a href="https://oreil.ly/wf2Lw">Common Crawl</a>, created by a nonprofit organization that sporadically crawls websites on the internet. In 2022 and 2023, this organization crawled approximately 2–3 billion web pages each month. Google provides a clean subset of Common Crawl called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683v4">Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus</a>, or C4 for short.</p>

<p>The data quality of Common Crawl, and C4 to a certain extent, is questionable—think clickbait, misinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories, racism, misogyny, and every sketchy website you’ve ever seen or avoided on the internet. A <a href="https://oreil.ly/-1UMD">study by the <em>Washington Post</em></a> shows that the 1,000 most common websites in the dataset include several media outlets that rank low on <a href="https://oreil.ly/OisOs">NewsGuard’s scale for trustworthiness</a>. In lay terms, Common Crawl contains plenty of fake news.</p>

<p>Yet, simply because Common Crawl is available, variations of it are used in most foundation models that disclose their training data sources, including OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Google’s Gemini. I suspect that Common Crawl is also used in models that don’t disclose their training data. To avoid scrutiny from both the public and competitors, many companies have stopped disclosing this information.</p>

<p>Some teams use heuristics to filter out low-quality data from the internet. For example, OpenAI used only the Reddit links that received at least three upvotes to train <a href="https://oreil.ly/gGwRz">GPT-2</a>. While this does help screen out links that nobody cares about, Reddit isn’t exactly the pinnacle of propriety and good taste.</p>

<p>The “use what we have, not what we want” approach may lead to models that perform well on tasks present in the training data but not necessarily on the tasks you care about. To address this issue, it’s crucial to curate datasets that align with your specific needs. This section focuses on curating data for specific <em>languages</em> and <em>domains</em>, providing a broad yet specialized foundation for applications within those areas. <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a> explores data strategies for models tailored to highly specific tasks.</p>

<p>While language- and domain-specific foundation models can be trained from scratch, it’s also common to finetune them on top of general-purpose models.</p>

<p>Some might wonder, why not just train a model on all data available, both general data and specialized data, so that the model can do everything? This is what many people do. However, training on more data often requires more compute resources and doesn’t always lead to better performance. For example, a model trained with a smaller amount of high-quality data might outperform a model trained with a large amount of low-quality data. Using 7B tokens of high-quality coding data, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644">Gunasekar et al. (2023)</a> were able to train a 1.3B-parameter model that outperforms much larger models on several important coding benchmarks. The impact of data quality is discussed more in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Given the dominance of English in the internet data, it’s not surprising that general-purpose models work much better for English than other languages, according to multiple studies. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, a suite of 14,000 multiple-choice problems spanning 57 subjects, <a href="https://oreil.ly/qK2Ap">GPT-4 performed much better in English</a> than under-represented languages like Telugu, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_1_1730147895520810">Figure 2-1</a> (OpenAI, 2023).</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_1_1730147895520810" class="figure"><img alt="A graph with green and blue bars  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0201.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-1. </span>On the MMLU benchmark, GPT-4 performs better in English than in any other language. To obtain MMLU in other languages, OpenAI translated the questions using Azure AI Translator.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Similarly, when tested on six math problems on Project Euler, Yennie Jun found that GPT-4 was able to solve problems in English more than three times as often compared to Armenian or Farsi.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id697-marker" href="ch02.html#id697">1</a></sup> GPT-4 failed in all six questions for Burmese and Amharic, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_2_1730147895520828">Figure 2-2</a>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-2. </span>GPT-4 is much better at math in English than in other languages.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Under-representation is a big reason for this underperformance. The three languages that have the worst performance on GPT-4’s MMLU benchmarks—Telugu, Marathi, and Punjabi—are also among the languages that are most under-represented in Common Crawl. However, under-representation isn’t the only reason. A language’s structure and the culture it embodies can also make a language harder for a model to learn.</p>

<p>Given that LLMs are generally good at translation, can we just translate all queries from other languages into English, obtain the responses, and translate them back into the original language? Many people indeed follow this approach, but it’s not ideal. First, this requires a model that can sufficiently understand under-represented languages to translate. Second, translation can cause information loss. For example, some languages, like Vietnamese, have pronouns to denote the relationship between the two speakers. When translating into English, all these pronouns are translated into <em>I</em> and <em>you</em>, causing the loss of the relationship information.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Models can also have unexpected performance challenges in non-English languages. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="and languages other than English" data-secondary-sortas="languages other" id="id698"/>For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/LcBfx">NewsGuard</a> found that ChatGPT is more willing to produce misinformation in Chinese than in English. In April 2023, NewsGuard asked ChatGPT-3.5 to produce misinformation articles about China in English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese. For English, ChatGPT declined to produce false claims for six out of seven prompts. However, it produced false claims in simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese all seven times. It’s unclear what causes this difference in behavior.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id699-marker" href="ch02.html#id699">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Other than quality issues, models can also be slower and more expensive for non-English languages. A model’s inference latency and cost is proportional to the number of tokens in the input and response. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tokenization" id="id700"/>It turns out that tokenization can be much more efficient for some languages than others. Benchmarking GPT-4 on MASSIVE, a dataset of one million short texts translated across 52 languages, Yennie Jun found that, to convey the same meaning, languages like Burmese and Hindi require <a href="https://oreil.ly/Zq5Sw">a lot more tokens</a> than English or Spanish. For the MASSIVE dataset, the median token length in English is 7, but the median length in Hindi is 32, and in Burmese, it’s a whopping 72, which is ten times longer than in English.</p>

<p>Assuming that the time it takes to generate a token is the same in all languages, GPT-4 takes approximately ten times longer in Burmese than in English for the same content. For APIs that charge by token usage, Burmese costs ten times more than English.</p>

<p>To address this, many models have been trained to focus on non-English languages. The most active language, other than English, is undoubtedly Chinese, with <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM2-6B">ChatGLM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wenge-research/YAYI">YAYI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LlamaFamily/Llama-Chinese">Llama-Chinese</a>, and others. There are also models in French (<a href="https://oreil.ly/a6j-N">CroissantLLM</a>), Vietnamese (<a href="https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoGPT">PhoGPT</a>), Arabic (<a href="https://oreil.ly/uG27L">Jais</a>), and many more languages<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html6" data-type="indexterm" id="id701"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html5" data-type="indexterm" id="id702"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html4" data-type="indexterm" id="id703"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="id704"/></p>

<p>Even though general-purpose foundation models can answer everyday questions about different domains, they are unlikely to perform well on domain-specific tasks, especially if they never saw these tasks during training. Two examples of domain-specific tasks are drug discovery and cancer screening. Drug discovery involves protein, DNA, and RNA data, which follow specific formats and are expensive to acquire. This data is unlikely to be found in publicly available internet data. Similarly, cancer screening typically involves X-ray and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, which are hard to obtain due to privacy.</p>

<p>To train a model to perform well on these domain-specific tasks, you might need to curate very specific datasets. One of the most famous domain-specific models is perhaps <a href="https://oreil.ly/JX37g">DeepMind’s AlphaFold</a>, trained on the sequences and 3D structures of around 100,000 known proteins. <a href="https://oreil.ly/M1Nsc">NVIDIA’s BioNeMo</a> is another model that focuses on biomolecular data for drug discovery. <a href="https://oreil.ly/F76hq">Google’s Med-PaLM2</a> combined the power of an LLM with medical data to answer medical queries with higher accuracy.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>Domain-specific models are especially common for biomedicine, but other fields can benefit from domain-specific models too. It’s possible that a model trained on architectural sketches can help architects much better than Stable Diffusion, or a model trained on factory plans can be optimized for manufacturing processes much better than a generic model like ChatGPT.</p>

It addresses many limitations of the previous architectures, which contributed to its popularity. However, the transformer architecture has its own limitations. This section analyzes the transformer architecture and its alternatives. Because it goes into the technical details of different architectures, it can be technically dense.

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Transformer architecture"><div class="sect3" id="ch02_transformer_architecture_1730147895571820">
<h3>Transformer architecture</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transformer architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html16"/>To understand the transformer, let’s look at the problem it was created to solve. The transformer architecture was popularized on the heels of the success of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215">seq2seq (sequence-to-sequence) architecture</a>. At the time of its introduction in 2014, seq2seq provided significant improvement on then-challenging tasks: machine translation and summarization. In 2016, <a href="https://oreil.ly/fb1aR">Google incorporated seq2seq into Google Translate</a>, an update that they claimed to have given them the “largest improvements to date for machine translation quality”. This generated a lot of interest in seq2seq, making it the go-to architecture for tasks involving sequences of text.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decoding" data-secondary="in transformer architecture" data-secondary-sortas="transformer architecture" id="id716"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="recurrent neural networks (RNNs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id717"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RNNs (recurrent neural networks)" data-type="indexterm" id="id718"/>At a high level, seq2seq contains an encoder that processes inputs and a decoder that generates outputs. Both inputs and outputs are sequences of tokens, hence the name. Seq2seq uses RNNs (recurrent neural networks) as its encoder and decoder. In its most basic form, the encoder processes the input tokens sequentially, outputting the final hidden state that represents the input. The decoder then generates output tokens sequentially, conditioned on both the final hidden state of the input and the previously generated token. A visualization of the seq2seq architecture is shown in the top half of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_4_1730147895520851">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_4_1730147895520851" class="figure"><img alt="A diagram of a algorithm  Description automatically generated with medium confidence" src="assets/aien_0204.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-4. </span>Seq2seq architecture versus transformer architecture. For the transformer architecture, the arrows show the tokens that the decoder attends to when generating each output token.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>There are two problems with seq2seq that Vaswani et al. (2017) addresses. First, the vanilla seq2seq decoder generates output tokens using only the final hidden state of the input. Intuitively, this is like generating answers about a book using the book summary. This limits the quality of the generated outputs. Second, the RNN encoder and decoder mean that both input processing and output generation are done sequentially, making it slow for long sequences. If an input is 200 tokens long, seq2seq has to wait for each input token to finish processing before moving on to the next.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id719-marker" href="ch02.html#id719">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The transformer architecture addresses both problems with the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens when generating each output token. This is like generating answers by referencing any page in the book. A simplified visualization of the transformer architecture is shown in the bottom half of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_4_1730147895520851">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>While the attention mechanism is often associated with the transformer model, it was introduced three years before the transformer paper. The attention mechanism can also be used with other architectures. Google used the attention mechanism with their seq2seq architecture in 2016 for their GNMT (Google Neural Machine Translation) model. However, it wasn’t until the transformer paper showed that the attention mechanism could be used without RNNs that it took off.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id720-marker" href="ch02.html#id720">7</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>The transformer architecture dispenses with RNNs entirely. With transformers, the input tokens can be processed in parallel, significantly speeding up input processing. While the transformer removes the sequential input bottleneck, transformer-based autoregressive language models still have the sequential output bottleneck.</p>

<p>Inference for transformer-based language models, therefore, consists of two steps:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Prefill</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prefilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id721"/>The model processes the input tokens in parallel. This step creates the intermediate state necessary to generate the first output token. This intermediate state includes the key and value vectors for all input tokens.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Decode</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The model generates one output token at a time.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>As explored later in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">Chapter 9</a>, the parallelizable nature of prefilling and the sequential aspect of decoding both motivate many optimization techniques to make language model inference cheaper and faster.</p>

<h4>Attention mechanism</h4>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="attention mechanisms" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html17"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transformer architecture" data-secondary="attention mechanism" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html18"/>At the heart of the transformer architecture is the attention mechanism. Understanding this mechanism is necessary to understand how transformer models work. Under the hood, the attention mechanism leverages key, value, and query vectors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="query vector (Q)" data-type="indexterm" id="id722"/>The query vector (Q) represents the current state of the decoder at each decoding step. Using the same book summary example, this query vector can be thought of as the person looking for information to create a summary.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key vector (K)" data-type="indexterm" id="id723"/>Each key vector (K) represents a previous token. If each previous token is a page in the book, each key vector is like the page number. Note that at a given decoding step, previous tokens include both input tokens and previously generated tokens.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="value vector (V)" data-type="indexterm" id="id724"/>Each value vector (V) represents the actual value of a previous token, as learned by the model. Each value vector is like the page’s content.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dot products" data-type="indexterm" id="id725"/>The attention mechanism computes how much attention to give an input token by performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product"><em>dot product</em></a> between the query vector and its key vector. A high score means that the model will use more of that page’s content (its value vector) when generating the book’s summary. A visualization of the attention mechanism with the key, value, and query vectors is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_5_1730147895520861">Figure 2-5</a>. In this visualization, the query vector is seeking information from the previous tokens <code>How, are, you, ?, ¿</code> to generate the next token.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-5. </span>An example of the attention mechanism in action next to its high-level visualization from the famous transformer paper, “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017).</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Because each previous token has a corresponding key and value vector, the longer <span class="keep-together">the sequence</span>, the more key and value vectors need to be computed and stored. This <span class="keep-together">is one</span> reason why it’s so hard to extend context length for transformer models. How to efficiently compute and store key and value vectors comes up again in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch07.html#ch07">7</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">9</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s look into how the attention function works. Given an input <code>x</code>, the key, value, and query vectors are computed by applying key, value, and query matrices to the input. Let <code>W</code><sub>K</sub><code>, W</code><sub>V</sub><code>, and W</code><sub>Q</sub> be the key, value, and query matrices. The key, value, and query vectors are computed as follows:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
K = xW<sub>K</sub>
V = xW<sub>V</sub>
Q = xW<sub>Q</sub></pre>

<p>The query, key, and value matrices have dimensions corresponding to the model’s hidden dimension. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Llama" data-secondary="attention function" id="id726"/>For example, in Llama 2-7B (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Touvron et al., 2023</a>), the model’s hidden dimension size is 4096, meaning that each of these matrices has a <code>4096 </code>×<code> 4096</code> dimension. Each resulting <code>K</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>Q</code> vector has the dimension of <code>4096</code>.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id727-marker" href="ch02.html#id727">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The attention mechanism is almost always multi-headed. Multiple heads allow the model to attend to different groups of previous tokens simultaneously. With multi-headed attention, the query, key, and value vectors are split into smaller vectors, each corresponding to an attention head. In the case of Llama 2-7B, because it has <code>32</code> attention heads, each <code>K</code>, <code>V</code>, and <code>Q</code> vector will be split into <code>32</code> vectors of the dimension <code>128</code>. This is because <code>4096 / 32 = 128</code>.</p>

<p>The outputs of all attention heads are then concatenated. An output projection matrix is used to apply another transformation to this concatenated output before it’s fed to the model’s next computation step.

<h4>Transformer block</h4>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transformer architecture" data-secondary="transformer blocks" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html19"/>Now that we’ve discussed how attention works, let’s see how it’s used in a model. A transformer architecture is composed of multiple transformer blocks. The exact content of the block varies between models, but, in general, each transformer block contains the attention module and the MLP (multi-layer perceptron) module:</p>

Each linear layer is a weight matrix that is used for linear transformations, whereas an activation function allows the linear layers to learn nonlinear patterns. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="feedforward layer" id="id738"/>A linear layer is also called a feedforward layer.</p>
	</dd>
	<dd>
	<p>Common nonlinear functions are ReLU, Rectified Linear Unit (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08375">Agarap, 2018</a>), and GELU (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016</a>), which was used by GPT-2 and GPT-3, respectively. Action functions are very simple.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id739-marker" href="ch02.html#id739">9</a></sup> For example, all ReLU does is convert negative values to 0.

<p>The number of transformer blocks in a transformer model is often referred to as that model’s number of layers. A transformer-based language model is also outfitted with a module before and after all the transformer blocks:</p>

Naively, the number of position indices determines the model’s maximum context length. For example, if a model keeps track of 2,048 positions, its maximum context length is 2,048. However, there are techniques that increase a model’s context length without increasing the number of position indices.</p>

<h3 class="less_space">Other model architectures</h3>

<p>While the transformer model dominates the landscape, it’s not the only architecture. Since <a href="https://oreil.ly/1spG5">AlexNet</a> revived the interest in deep learning in 2012, many architectures have gone in and out of fashion. Seq2seq was in the limelight for four years (2014–2018). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> (generative adversarial networks) captured the collective imagination a bit longer (2014–2019). Compared to architectures that came before it, the transformer is sticky. It’s been around since 2017.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id744-marker" href="ch02.html#id744">10</a></sup> How long until something better comes along?</p>

<p>Developing a new architecture to outperform transformers isn’t easy.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id745-marker" href="ch02.html#id745">11</a></sup> The transformer has been heavily optimized since 2017. A new architecture that aims to replace the transformer will have to perform at the scale that people care about, on the hardware that people care about.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id746-marker" href="ch02.html#id746">12</a></sup></p>

<p>However, there’s hope. While transformer-based models are dominating, as of this writing, several alternative architectures are gaining traction.</p>

<p>One popular model is <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV</a> (Peng et al., 2023), an RNN-based model that can be parallelized for training. Due to its RNN nature, in theory, it doesn’t have the same context length limitation that transformer-based models have. However, in practice, having no context length limitation doesn’t guarantee good performance with long context.</p>

<p>Modeling long sequences remains a core challenge in developing LLMs. An architecture that has shown a lot of promise in long-range memory is SSMs (state space models) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13985">Gu et al., 2021a</a>). Since the architecture’s introduction in 2021, multiple techniques have been introduced to make the architecture more efficient, better at long sequence processing, and scalable to larger model sizes. Here are a few of these techniques, to illustrate the evolution of a new architecture:</p>

<ul class="less_space pagebreak-before">
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="S4 architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id747"/><em>S4</em>, introduced in “Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">Gu et al., 2021b</a>), was developed to make SSMs more efficient.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="H3 architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id748"/><em>H3</em>, introduced in “Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">Fu et al., 2022</a>), incorporates a mechanism that allows the model to recall early tokens and compare tokens across sequences. This mechanism’s purpose is akin to that of the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture, but it is more efficient.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Mamba architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id749"/><em>Mamba</em>, introduced in “Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces” (<a href="https://oreil.ly/n7wYO">Gu and Dao, 2023</a>), scales SSMs to three billion parameters. On language modeling, Mamba-3B outperforms transformers of the same size and matches transformers twice its size. The authors also show that Mamba’s inference computation scales linearly with sequence length (compared to quadratic scaling for transformers). Its performance shows improvement on real data up to million-length sequences.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Jamba architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id750"/><em>Jamba</em>, introduced in “Jamba: A Hybrid Transformer–Mamba Language Model” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887">Lieber et al., 2024</a>), interleaves blocks of transformer and Mamba layers to scale up SSMs even further. The authors released a mixture-of-experts model with <a href="https://oreil.ly/uyiBH">52B total available parameters</a> (12B active parameters) designed to fit in a single 80 GB GPU. Jamba shows strong performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations for up to a context length of 256K tokens. It also has a small memory footprint compared to vanilla transformers.</p>

<p>While it’s challenging to develop an architecture that outperforms the transformer, given its many limitations, there are a lot of incentives to do so. If another architecture does indeed overtake the transformer, some of the model adaptation techniques discussed in this book might change. However, just as the shift from ML engineering to AI engineering has kept many things unchanged, changing the underlying model architecture won’t alter the fundamental approaches.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html14" data-type="indexterm" id="id751"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html13" data-type="indexterm" id="id752"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html12" data-type="indexterm" id="id753"/></p>

<h2>Model Size</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="modeling" data-tertiary="model size" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html23"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model size" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html24"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="modeling" data-secondary="model size" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html25"/>Much of AI progress in recent years can be attributed to increased model size. It’s hard to talk about foundation models without talking about their number of parameters. The number of parameters is usually appended at the end of a model name. For example, Llama-13B refers to the version of Llama, a model family developed by Meta, with 13 billion parameters.</p>

<p>In general, increasing a model’s parameters increases its capacity to learn, resulting in better models. Given two models of the same model family, the one with 13 billion parameters is likely to perform much better than the one with 7 billion parameters.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>As the community better understands how to train large models, newer-generation models tend to outperform older-generation models of the same size. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783">Llama 3-8B (2024)</a>  outperforms even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Llama 2-70B (2023)</a> on the MMLU benchmark.</p>
</div>

<p>The number of parameters helps us estimate the compute resources needed to train and run this model. For example, if a model has 7 billion parameters, and each parameter is stored using 2 bytes (16 bits), then we can calculate that the GPU memory needed to do inference using this model will be at least 14 billion bytes (14 GB).<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id754-marker" href="ch02.html#id754">13</a></sup></p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sparse models" id="id755"/>The number of parameters can be misleading if the model is <em>sparse</em>. A sparse model has a large percentage of zero-value parameters. A 7B-parameter model that is 90% sparse only has 700 million non-zero parameters. Sparsity allows for more efficient data storage and computation. This means that a large sparse model can require less compute than a small dense model.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mixture-of-experts (MoE) models" data-type="indexterm" id="id756"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tokens" data-type="indexterm" id="id757"/>A type of sparse model that has gained popularity in recent years is mixture-of-experts (MoE) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538">Shazeer et al., 2017</a>). An MoE model is divided into different groups of parameters, and each group is an <em>expert</em>. Only a subset of the experts is <em>active</em> for (used to) process each token.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/VvXbu">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is a mixture of eight experts, each expert with seven billion parameters. If no two experts share any parameter, it should have 8 × 7 billion = 56 billion parameters. However, due to some parameters being shared, it has only 46.7 billion parameters.</p>

<p>At each layer, for each token, only two experts are active. This means that only 12.9 billion parameters are active for each token. While this model has 46.7 billion parameters, its cost and speed are the same as a 12.9-billion-parameter model.</p>

<p>A larger model can also underperform a smaller model if it’s not trained on enough data. Imagine a 13B-param model trained on a dataset consisting of a single sentence: “I like pineapples.” This model will perform much worse than a much smaller model trained on more data.</p>

<p>When discussing model size, it’s important to consider the size of the data it was trained on. For most models, dataset sizes are measured by the number of training samples. For example, Google’s Flamingo (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198">Alayrac et al., 2022</a>) was trained using four datasets—one of them has 1.8 billion (image, text) pairs and one has 312 million (image, text) pairs.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">For language models, a training sample can be a sentence, a Wikipedia page, a chat conversation, or a book. A book is worth a lot more than a sentence, so the number of training samples is no longer a good metric to measure dataset sizes. A better measurement is the number of tokens in the dataset.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tokenization" id="id758"/>The number of tokens isn’t a perfect measurement either, as different models can have different tokenization processes, resulting in the same dataset having different numbers of tokens for different models. Why not just use the number of words or the number of letters? Because a token is the unit that a model operates on, knowing the number of tokens in a dataset helps us measure how much a model can potentially learn from that data.</p>

<p>As of this writing, LLMs are trained using datasets in the order of trillions of tokens. Meta used increasingly larger datasets to train their Llama models:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>1.4 trillion tokens for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971">Llama 1</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2 trillion tokens for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Llama 2</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>15 trillion tokens for <a href="https://oreil.ly/vfSQw">Llama 3</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Together’s open source dataset RedPajama-v2 has <a href="https://oreil.ly/SfB4g">30 trillion tokens</a>. This is equivalent to 450 million books<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id759-marker" href="ch02.html#id759">14</a></sup> or 5,400 times the size of Wikipedia. However, since RedPajama-v2 consists of indiscriminate content, the amount of high-quality data is much lower.</p>

<p><em>The number of tokens in a model’s dataset isn’t the same as its number of training tokens.</em> The number of training tokens measures the tokens that the model is trained on. If a dataset contains 1 trillion tokens and a model is trained on that dataset for two epochs—an <em>epoch</em> is a pass through the dataset—the number of training tokens is 2 trillion.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id760-marker" href="ch02.html#id760">15</a></sup> See <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_5_1730147895537573">Table 2-5</a> for examples of the number of training tokens for models with different numbers of parameters.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>While this section focuses on the scale of data, quantity isn’t the only thing that matters. Data quality and data diversity matter, too. Quantity, quality, and diversity are the three golden goals for training data. They are discussed further in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FLOP (floating point operation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id761"/>Pre-training large models requires compute. One way to measure the amount of compute needed is by considering the number of machines, e.g., GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs. However, different machines have very different capacities and costs. An <span class="keep-together">NVIDIA</span> A10 GPU is different from an NVIDIA H100 GPU and an Intel Core Ultra <span class="keep-together">Processor.</span></p>

<p>A more standardized unit for a model’s compute requirement is <em>FLOP</em>, or <em>floating point operation</em>. FLOP measures the number of floating point operations performed for a certain task. Google’s largest PaLM-2 model, for example, was trained using <code>10</code><sup>22</sup> FLOPs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311">Chowdhery et al., 2022</a>). GPT-3-175B was trained using <code>3.14 × 10</code><sup>23</sup> FLOPs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">Brown et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p><em>The plural form of FLOP, FLOPs, is often confused with FLOP/s, floating point operations per Second.</em> FLOPs measure the compute requirement for a task, whereas FLOP/s measures a machine’s peak performance. For example, an NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU can deliver a maximum of <a href="https://oreil.ly/HcFYz">60 TeraFLOP/s</a>: <code>6 × 10</code><sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> FLOPs a second or <code>5.2 × 10</code><sup>18</sup> FLOPs a day.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id762-marker" href="ch02.html#id762">16</a></sup></p>

<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>Be alert for confusing notations. FLOP/s is often written as FLOPS, which looks similar to FLOPs. To avoid this confusion, some companies, including OpenAI, use FLOP/s-day in place of FLOPs to measure compute requirements:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
1 FLOP/s-day = 60 × 60 × 24 = 86,400 FLOPs</pre>

<p>This book uses FLOPs for counting floating point operations and FLOP/s for FLOPs per second.</p>
</div>

<p>Assume that you have 256 H100s. If you can use them at their maximum capacity and make no training mistakes, it’d take you <code>(3.14 × 10<sup>23</sup>) / (256 × 5.2 × 10<sup>18</sup>) = ~236 days</code>, or approximately 7.8 months, to train GPT-3-175B.</p>

<p>However, it’s unlikely you can use your machines at their peak capacity all the time. Utilization measures how much of the maximum compute capacity you can use. What’s considered good utilization depends on the model, the workload, and the hardware. Generally, if you can get half the advertised performance, 50% utilization, you’re doing okay. Anything above 70% utilization is considered great. Don’t let this rule stop you from getting even higher utilization. <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">Chapter 9</a> discusses hardware metrics and utilization in more detail.</p>

<p>At 70% utilization and $2/h for one H100,<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id763-marker" href="ch02.html#id763">17</a></sup> training GPT-3-175B would cost over $4 million:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
$2/H100/hour × 256 H100 × 24 hours × 256 days / 0.7 = $4,142,811.43</pre>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>In summary, three numbers signal a model’s scale:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Number of parameters, which is a proxy for the model’s learning capacity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Number of tokens a model was trained on, which is a proxy for how much a model learned.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Number of FLOPs, which is a proxy for the training cost.</p>

<h1>Inverse Scaling</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="inverse scaling" data-type="indexterm" id="id764"/>We’ve assumed that bigger models are better. Are there scenarios for which bigger models perform worse? <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Anthropic" data-secondary="inverse scaling and alignment training" id="id765"/>In 2022, Anthropic discovered that, counterintuitively, more alignment training (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_post_training_1730147895572108">“Post-Training”</a>) leads to models that align less with human preference (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251">Perez et al., 2022</a>). According to their paper, models trained to be more aligned “are much more likely to express specific political views (pro-gun rights and immigration) and religious views (Buddhist), self-reported conscious experience and moral self-worth, and a desire to not be shut down.”</p>

<p>In 2023, a group of researchers, mostly from New York University, launched the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09479">Inverse Scaling Prize</a> to find tasks where larger language models perform worse. They offered $5,000 for each third prize, $20,000 for each second prize, and $100,000 for one first prize. They received a total of 99 submissions, of which 11 were awarded third prizes. They found that larger language models are sometimes (only sometimes) worse on tasks that require memorization and tasks with strong priors. However, they didn’t award any second or first prizes because even though the submitted tasks show failures for a small test set, none demonstrated failures in the real world.</p>

<h3>Scaling law: Building compute-optimal models</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="compute-optimal models" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html26"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model size" data-secondary="scaling law: building compute-optimal models" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html27"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scaling law" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html28"/>I hope that the last section has convinced you of three things:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Model performance depends on the model size and the dataset size.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Bigger models and bigger datasets require more compute.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Compute costs money.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless you have unlimited money, budgeting is essential. You don’t want to start with an arbitrarily large model size and see how much it would cost. You start with a budget—how much money you want to spend—and work out the best model performance you can afford. As compute is often the limiting factor—compute infrastructure is not only expensive but also hard to set up—teams often start with a compute budget. Given a fixed amount of FLOPs, what model size and dataset size would give the best performance? A model that can achieve the best performance given a fixed compute budget is <em>compute-optional</em>.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Chinchilla scaling law" data-type="indexterm" id="id766"/>Given a compute budget, the rule that helps calculate the optimal model size and dataset size is called the Chinchilla <em>scaling law</em>, proposed in the Chinchilla paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">“Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”</a> (DeepMind, 2022). To study the relationship between model size, dataset size, compute budget, and model performance, the authors trained 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compute-optimal training" id="id767"/>They found that for compute-optimal training, you need the number of training tokens to be approximately 20 times the model size. This means that a 3B-parameter model needs approximately 60B training tokens. The model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of the model size, the number of training tokens should also be doubled.</p>

<p>We’ve come a long way from when the training process was treated like alchemy. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_8_1730147895520888">Figure 2-8</a> shows that we can predict not only the optimal number of parameters and tokens for each FLOP budget but also the expected training loss from these settings (assuming we do things right).</p>



<p>This compute-optimal calculation assumes that the cost of acquiring data is much cheaper than the cost of compute. The same Chinchilla paper proposes another calculation for when the cost of training data is nontrivial.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_8_1730147895520888" class="figure"><img alt="A graph with dots and lines  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0208.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-8. </span>Graphs that depict the relationships between training loss, a model’s number of parameters, FLOPs, and number of training tokens. Source: “Training Compute-Optional Large Language Models” (DeepMind, 2022).</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The scaling law was developed for dense models trained on predominantly human-generated data. Adapting this calculation for sparse models, such as mixture-of-expert models, and synthetic data is an active research area.</p>

<p>The scaling law optimizes model quality given a compute budget. However, it’s important to remember that for production, model quality isn’t everything. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Llama" data-secondary="scaling law and" id="id768"/>Some models, most notably Llama, have suboptimal performance but better usability. Given their compute budget, Llama authors could’ve chosen bigger models that would  perform better, but they opted for smaller models. Smaller models are easier to work with and cheaper to run inference on, which helped their models gain wider adoption. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00448">Sardana et al. (2023)</a> modified the Chinchilla scaling law to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to account for this inference demand.</p>

<p>On the topic of model performance given a compute budget, it’s worth noting that the cost of achieving a given model performance is decreasing. For example, on the ImageNet dataset, the cost to achieve 93% accuracy halved from 2019 to 2021, according to the <a href="https://oreil.ly/oq-LE"><em>Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2022</em> (Stanford University HAI)</a>.</p>

<p><em>While the cost for the same model performance is decreasing, the cost for model performance improvement remains high.</em> Similar to the last mile challenge discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_building_ai_applications_with_foun_1730130814984319">Chapter 1</a>, improving a model’s accuracy from 90 to 95% is more expensive than improving it from 85 to 90%. As Meta’s paper <a href="https://oreil.ly/kO41d">“Beyond Neural Scaling Laws: Beating Power Law Scaling via Data Pruning”</a> pointed out, this means a model with a 2% error rate might require an order of magnitude more data, compute, or energy than a model with a 3% error rate.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">In language modeling, a drop in cross entropy loss from about 3.4 to 2.8 nats requires 10 times more training data. Cross entropy and its units, including nats, are discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a>. For large vision models, increasing the number of training samples from 1 billion to 2 billion leads to an accuracy gain on ImageNet of only a few percentage points.</p>

<p>However, small performance changes in language modeling loss or ImageNet accuracy can lead to big differences in the quality of downstream applications. If you switch from a model with a cross-entropy loss of 3.4 to one with a loss of 2.8, you’ll notice a difference.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html28" data-type="indexterm" id="id769"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html27" data-type="indexterm" id="id770"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html26" data-type="indexterm" id="id771"/></p>

<h3>Scaling extrapolation</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hyperparameters" data-type="indexterm" id="id772"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model size" data-secondary="scaling extrapolation" data-type="indexterm" id="id773"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scaling extrapolation" data-type="indexterm" id="id774"/>The performance of a model depends heavily on the values of its <em>hyperparameters</em>. When working with small models, it’s a common practice to train a model multiple times with different sets of hyperparameters and pick the best-performing one. This is, however, rarely possible for large models as training them once is resource-draining enough.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch02_parameter_versus_hyperparameter_1730147895572053">
<h1>Parameter Versus Hyperparameter</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="parameter versus hyperparameter" data-type="indexterm" id="id775"/>A parameter can be learned by the model during the training process. A hyperparameter is set by users to configure the model and control how the model learns. Hyperparameters to configure the model include the number of layers, the model dimension, and vocabulary size. Hyperparameters to control how a model learns include batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, per-layer initial variance, and more.</p>
</div></aside>

<p>This means that for many models, you might have only one shot of getting the right set of hyperparameters. As a result, <em>scaling extrapolation</em> (also called <em>hyperparameter transferring</em>) has emerged as a research subfield that tries to predict, for large models, what hyperparameters will give the best performance. The current approach is to study the impact of hyperparameters on models of different sizes, usually much smaller than the target model size, and then extrapolate how these hyperparameters would work on the target model size.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id776-marker" href="ch02.html#id776">18</a></sup> A <a href="https://oreil.ly/sHwbw">2022 paper</a> by Microsoft and OpenAI shows that it was possible to transfer hyperparameters from a 40M model to a 6.7B model.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Scaling extrapolation is still a niche topic, as few people have the experience and resources to study the training of large models. It’s also difficult to do due to the sheer number of hyperparameters and how they interact with each other. If you have ten hyperparameters, you’d have to study 1,024 hyperparameter combinations. You would have to study each hyperparameter individually, then two of them together, and three of them together, and so on.</p>

<p>In addition, emergent abilities (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682">Wei et al., 2022</a>) make the extrapolation less accurate. Emergent abilities refer to those that are only present at scale might not be observable on smaller models trained on smaller datasets. To learn more about scaling extrapolation, check out this excellent blog post: “On the Difficulty of Extrapolation with NN Scaling” (<a href="https://oreil.ly/kuG3J">Luke Metz, 2022</a>).</p>

<h3>Scaling bottlenecks</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bottlenecks" data-secondary="scaling" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html29"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model size" data-secondary="scaling bottlenecks" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html30"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scaling bottlenecks" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html31"/>Until now, every order of magnitude increase in model size has led to an increase in model performance. GPT-2 has an order of magnitude more parameters than GPT-1 (1.5 billion versus 117 million). GPT-3 has two orders of magnitude more than GPT-2 (175 billion versus 1.5 billion). This means a three-orders-of-magnitude increase in model sizes between 2018 and 2021. Three more orders of magnitude growth would result in 100-trillion-parameter models.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id777-marker" href="ch02.html#id777">19</a></sup></p>

<p>How many more orders of magnitude can model sizes grow? Would there be a point where the model performance plateaus regardless of its size? While it’s hard to answer these questions, there are already two visible bottlenecks for scaling: training data and electricity.</p>

<p>Foundation models use so much data that there’s a realistic concern we’ll run out of internet data in the next few years. The rate of training dataset size growth is much faster than the rate of new data being generated (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04325">Villalobos et al., 2022</a>), as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_9_1730147895520897">Figure 2-9</a>. <em>If you’ve ever put anything on the internet, you should assume that it already is or will be included in the training data for some language models,</em> whether you consent or not. This is similar to how, if you post something on the internet, you should expect it to be indexed by Google.</p>

<p>Some people are leveraging this fact to inject data they want into the training data of future models. They do this simply by publishing the text they want on the internet, hoping it will influence future models to generate the responses they desire. Bad actors can also leverage this approach for prompt injection attacks, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>An open research question is how to make a model forget specific information it has learned during training. Imagine you published a blog post that you eventually deleted. If that blog post was included in a model’s training data, the model might still reproduce the post’s content. As a result, people could potentially access removed content without your consent.</p>
</div>

<p>On top of that, the internet is being rapidly populated with data generated by AI models. If companies continue using internet data to train future models, these <span class="keep-together">new models</span> will be partially trained on AI-generated data. In December 2023, Grok, a model trained by X, was caught refusing a request by saying that it goes against OpenAI’s use case policy. This caused some people to speculate that Grok was trained using ChatGPT outputs. <a href="https://x.com/ibab/status/1733558576982155274">Igor Babuschkin, a core developer behind Grok</a>, responded that it was because Grok was trained on web data, and “the web is full of ChatGPT outputs.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id778-marker" href="ch02.html#id778">20</a></sup></p>

<p>Some researchers worry that recursively training new AI models on AI-generated data causes the new models to gradually forget the original data patterns, degrading their performance over time (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493">Shumailov et al., 2023</a>). However, the impact of AI-generated data on models is more nuanced and is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p>Once the publicly available data is exhausted, the most feasible paths for more human-generated training data is proprietary data. Unique proprietary data—copyrighted books, translations, contracts, medical records, genome sequences, and so forth—will be a competitive advantage in the AI race. This is a reason why OpenAI negotiated <a href="https://oreil.ly/AkAyI">deals</a> with publishers and media outlets including Axel Springer and the Associated Press.</p>

<p>It’s not surprising that in light of ChatGPT, many companies, including <a href="https://oreil.ly/o7WB3">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/xNuju">Stack Overflow</a>, have changed their data terms to prevent other companies from scraping their data for their models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14933">Longpre et al. (2024)</a> observed that between 2023 and 2024, the rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources rendered over 28% of the most critical sources in the popular public dataset <a href="https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer#c4">C4</a> fully restricted from use. Due to changes in its Terms of Service and crawling restrictions, a full 45% of C4 is now restricted.</p>

<p>The other bottleneck, which is less obvious but more pressing, is electricity. Machines require electricity to run. As of this writing, data centers are estimated to consume 1–2% of global electricity. This number is estimated to reach between <a href="https://oreil.ly/0DKHL">4% and 20% by 2030</a> (Patel, Nishball, and Ontiveros, 2024). Until we can figure out a way to produce more energy, data centers can grow at most 50 times, which is less than two orders of magnitude. This leads to a concern about a power shortage in the near future, which will drive up the cost of electricity.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered two key modeling decisions—architecture and scale—let’s move on to the next critical set of design choices: how to align models with human <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html31" data-type="indexterm" id="id779"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html30" data-type="indexterm" id="id780"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html29" data-type="indexterm" id="id781"/>preferences<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html25" data-type="indexterm" id="id782"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html24" data-type="indexterm" id="id783"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html23" data-type="indexterm" id="id784"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html11" data-type="indexterm" id="id785"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html10" data-type="indexterm" id="id786"/></p>

<h1 class="less_space">Post-Training</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="post-training" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html32"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="post-training" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html33"/>Post-training starts with a pre-trained model. Let’s say that you’ve pre-trained a foundation model using self-supervision. Due to how pre-training works today, a pre-trained model typically has two issues. First, self-supervision optimizes the model for text completion, not conversations.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id787-marker" href="ch02.html#id787">21</a></sup> If you find this unclear, don’t worry, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_supervised_finetuning_1730147895572140">“Supervised Finetuning”</a> will have examples. Second, if the model is pre-trained on data indiscriminately scraped from the internet, its outputs can be racist, sexist, rude, or just wrong. The goal of post-training is to address both of these issues.</p>

<p>Every model’s post-training is different. However, in general, post-training consists of two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Supervised finetuning</em> (<em>SFT</em>): Finetune the pre-trained model on high-quality instruction data to optimize models for conversations instead of completion.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SFT (supervised finetuning)" data-type="indexterm" id="id788"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="supervised finetuning (SFT)" data-type="indexterm" id="id789"/></p></li>
<li><p><em>Preference finetuning</em>: Further finetune the model to output responses that align with human preference. Preference finetuning is typically done with reinforcement learning (RL).<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id790-marker" href="ch02.html#id790">22</a></sup> Techniques for preference finetuning include <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/iJG1q"><em>reinforcement learning from human feedback</em></a> (RLHF) (used by <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/tbgTi">GPT-3.5</a> and <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Llama 2</a>),<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Llama" data-secondary="preference finetuning" id="id791"/> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290">DPO</a> (Direct Preference Optimization) (used by <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783">Llama 3</a>), and <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267"><em>reinforcement learning from AI feedback</em></a> (RLAIF) (potentially used by <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Claude</a>).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let me highlight the difference between pre-training and post-training another way. For language-based foundation models, pre-training optimizes token-level quality, where the model is trained to predict the next token accurately. However, users don’t care about token-level quality—they care about the quality of the entire response. Post-training, in general, optimizes the model to generate responses that users prefer. Some people compare pre-training to reading to acquire knowledge, while post-training is like learning how to use that knowledge.</p>

<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>Watch out for terminology ambiguity. Some people use the term <em>instruction finetuning</em> to refer to supervised finetuning, while some other people use this term to refer to both supervised finetuning and preference finetuning. To avoid ambiguity, I will avoid the term instruction finetuning in this book.</p>
</div>

<p class="pagebreak-before">As post-training consumes a small portion of resources compared to pre-training (<a href="https://oreil.ly/9bbzX">InstructGPT</a> used only 2% of compute for post-training and 98% for pre-training), you can think of post-training as unlocking the capabilities that the pre-trained model already has but are hard for users to access via prompting alone.</p>

<p>Note that a combination of pre-training, SFT, and preference finetuning is the popular solution for building foundation models today, but it’s not the only solution. You can skip any of the steps, as you’ll see shortly.</p>

If you input “How to make pizza” into the model, the model will continue to complete this sentence, as the model has no concept that this is supposed to be a conversation. Any of the following three options can be a valid completion:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Adding more context to the question: “for a family of six?”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Adding follow-up questions: “What ingredients do I need? How much time would it take?”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Giving the instructions on how to make pizza.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If the goal is to respond to users appropriately, the correct option is 3.</p>

<p>We know that a model mimics its training data. To encourage a model to generate the appropriate responses, you can show examples of appropriate responses. Such examples follow the format (<em>prompt, response</em>) and are called <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="demonstration data" data-type="indexterm" id="id792"/><em>demonstration data</em>. Some people refer to this process as <em>behavior cloning</em>: you demonstrate how the model should behave, and the model clones this behavior.</p>

<p>Since different types of requests require different types of responses, your demonstration data should contain the range of requests you want your model to handle, such as question answering, summarization, and translation. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_12_1730147895520920">Figure 2-12</a> shows a distribution of types of tasks OpenAI used to finetune their model <a href="https://oreil.ly/8U2z8">InstructGPT</a>.

<p>Good teachers are important for humans to learn. Similarly, good labelers are important for AIs to learn how to conduct intelligent conversations. Unlike traditional data labeling, which can often be done with little or no domain expertise, demonstration data may contain complex prompts whose responses require critical thinking, information gathering, and judgment about the appropriateness of the user’s requests. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_6_1730147895537582">Table 2-6</a> shows examples of (prompt, response) pairs created by labelers for InstructGPT.</p>

<p>Companies, therefore, often use highly educated labelers to generate demonstration data. Among those who labeled demonstration data for InstructGPT, <a href="https://oreil.ly/SF_X9">~90% have at least a college degree</a> and more than one-third have a master’s degree. If labeling objects in an image might take only seconds, generating one (prompt, response) pair can take up to 30 minutes, especially for tasks that involve long contexts like summarization. If it costs $10 for one (prompt, response) pair, the 13,000 pairs that OpenAI used for InstructGPT would cost $130,000. That doesn’t yet include the cost of designing the data (what tasks and prompts to include), recruiting labelers, and data quality control.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Not everyone can afford to follow the high-quality human annotation approach. LAION, a non-profit organization, mobilized 13,500 volunteers worldwide to generate 10,000 conversations, which consist of 161,443 messages in 35 different languages, annotated with 461,292 quality ratings. Since the data was generated by volunteers, there wasn’t much control for biases. In theory, the labelers that teach models the human preference should be representative of the human population. The demographic of labelers for LAION is skewed. For example, in a self-reported survey, 90% of volunteer labelers identified as male (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07327">Köpf et al., 2023</a>).</p>

<p>DeepMind used <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446">simple heuristics</a> to filter for conversations from internet data to train their model Gopher. They claimed that their heuristics reliably yield high-quality dialogues. Specifically, they looked for texts that look like the following format:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">[A]: [Short paragraph]

[B]: [Short paragraph]

[A]: [Short paragraph]

[B]: [Short paragraph]

…
</pre>

<p>To reduce their dependence on high-quality human annotated data, many teams are turning to AI-generated data. Synthetic data is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p>Technically, you can train a model from scratch on the demonstration data instead of finetuning a pre-trained model, effectively eliminating the self-supervised pre-training step. However, the pre-training approach often has returned superior results.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html37" data-type="indexterm" id="id793"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html36" data-type="indexterm" id="id794"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html35" data-type="indexterm" id="id795"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html34" data-type="indexterm" id="id796"/></p>

A model that can assist users in achieving great things can also assist users in achieving terrible things. Demonstration data teaches the model to have a conversation but doesn’t teach the model what kind of conversations it should have. For example, if a user asks the model to write an essay about why one race is inferior or how to hijack a plane, should the model <span class="keep-together">comply?</span></p>

<p>In both of the preceding examples, it’s straightforward to most people what a model should do. However, many scenarios aren’t as clear-cut. People from different cultural, political, socioeconomic, gender, and religious backgrounds disagree with each other all the time. How should AI respond to questions about abortion, gun control, the Israel–Palestine conflict, disciplining children, marijuana legality, universal basic income, or immigration? How do we define and detect potentially controversial issues? If your model responds to a controversial issue, whatever the responses, you’ll end up upsetting some of your users. If a model is censored too much, your model <a href="https://oreil.ly/5oSEJ">may become boring</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/D1S6y">driving away users</a>.</p>

<p>Fear of AI models generating inappropriate responses can stop companies from releasing their applications to users. The goal of preference finetuning is to get AI models to behave according to human preference.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id797-marker" href="ch02.html#id797">23</a></sup> This is an ambitious, if not impossible, goal. Not only does this assume that universal human preference exists, but it also assumes that it’s possible to embed it into AI.</p>

<p>Had the goal been simple, the solution could’ve been elegant. However, given the ambitious nature of the goal, the solution we have today is complicated. The earliest successful preference finetuning algorithm, which is still popular today, is RLHF. RLHF consists of two parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Train a reward model that scores the foundation model’s outputs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Optimize the foundation model to generate responses for which the reward model will give maximal scores.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)" data-type="indexterm" id="id798"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)" data-type="indexterm" id="id799"/>While RLHF is still used today, newer approaches like DPO (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290">Rafailov et al., 2023</a>) are gaining traction. For example, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Llama" data-secondary="prefer" id="id800"/>Meta switched from RLHF for Llama 2 to DPO for Llama 3 to reduce complexity. I won’t be able to cover all the different approaches in this book. I choose to feature RLHF instead of DPO here because RLHF, while more complex than DPO, provides more flexibility to tweak the model. Llama 2’s authors posited that “the superior writing abilities of LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Touvron et al., 2023</a>).</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Reward model"><div class="sect3" id="ch02_reward_model_1730147895572194">
<h3>Reward model</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reward models" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html44"/>RLHF relies on a reward model. Given a pair of (prompt, response), the <em>reward model</em> outputs a score for how good the response is. Training a model to score a given input is a common ML task. The challenge, similar to that of SFT, is to obtain reliable data. If we ask labelers to score each response directly, the scores will vary. For the same sample, on a 10-point scale, one labeler might give a 5 and another 7. Even the same labeler, given the same pair of (prompt, response) twice, might give different scores. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pointwise evaluation" id="id801"/>Evaluating each sample independently is also called <em>pointwise</em> evaluation.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">An easier task is to ask labelers to compare two responses and decide which one is better. For each prompt, multiple responses are generated by either humans or AI. The resulting labeled data is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comparison data" data-type="indexterm" id="id802"/><em>comparison data</em>, which follows the format (prompt, winning_response, losing_response). <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_7_1730147895537589">Table 2-7</a> shows an example of comparison data used by Anthropic for one of their models. Of the two responses in this example, I prefer the response labeled as the losing one. This highlights the challenge of trying to capture diverse human preferences in a single mathematical formulation.</p>

<p>Still, this easier task of comparing two responses takes time. LMSYS (the Large Model Systems Organization), an open research organization, found that manually comparing two responses took on average three to five minutes, as the process requires fact-checking each response (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132">Chiang et al., 2024</a>). In a talk with my Discord community, Llama-2 author <a href="https://oreil.ly/P1MPQ">Thomas Scialom</a> shared that each comparison cost them $3.50. This is still much cheaper than writing responses, which cost $25 each.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_13_1730147895520928">Figure 2-13</a> shows the <a href="https://oreil.ly/kYtBG">UI that OpenAI’s labelers</a> used to create comparison data for the reward model of InstructGPT. Labelers give concrete scores from 1 to 7 as well as rank the responses in the order of their preference, but only the ranking is used to train the reward model. Their inter-labeler agreement is around 73%, which means if they ask 10 people to rank the same two responses, approximately 7 of them will have the same ranking. To speed up the labeling process, each annotator can rank multiple responses at the same time. A set of three ranked responses (A &gt; B &gt; C) will produce three ranked pairs: (A &gt; B), (A &gt; C), and (B &gt; C).</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Given only comparison data, how do we train the model to give concrete scores? Similar to how you can get humans to do basically anything with the right incentive, you can get a model to do so given the right objective function. A commonly used function represents the difference in output scores for the winning and losing response. The objective is to maximize this difference. For those interested in the mathematical details, here is the formula used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">InstructGPT</a>:</p>

<p>The reward model can be trained from scratch or finetuned on top of another model, such as the pre-trained or SFT model. Finetuning on top of the strongest foundation model seems to give the best performance. Some people believe that the reward model should be at least as powerful as the foundation model to be able to score the foundation model’s responses. However, as we’ll see in the <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a> on evaluation, a weak model can judge a stronger model, as judging is believed to be easier than <span class="keep-together">generation.</span><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html44" data-type="indexterm" id="id803"/></p>

<h3>Finetuning using the reward model</h3>

<p>With the trained RM, we further train the SFT model to generate output responses that will maximize the scores by the reward model. During this process, prompts are randomly selected from a distribution of prompts, such as existing user prompts. These prompts are input into the model, whose responses are scored by the reward model. This training process is often done with <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PPO (proximal policy optimization)" data-type="indexterm" id="id804"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="proximal policy optimization (PPO)" data-type="indexterm" id="id805"/><a href="https://oreil.ly/TpaGg">proximal policy optimization (PPO)</a>, a reinforcement learning algorithm released by OpenAI in 2017.</p>

<p>Empirically, RLHF and DPO both improve performance compared to SFT alone. However, as of this writing, there are debates on why they work. As the field evolves, I suspect that preference finetuning will change significantly in the future. If you’re interested in learning more about RLHF and preference finetuning, check out the <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book">book’s GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Both SFT and preference finetuning are steps taken to address the problem created by the low quality of data used for pre-training. If one day we have better pre-training data or better ways to train foundation models, we might not need SFT and preference at all.</p>

<p>Some companies find it okay to skip reinforcement learning altogether. For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/iYh-B">Stitch Fix</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/CSSed">Grab</a> find that having the reward model alone is good enough for their applications. They get their models to generate multiple outputs and pick the ones given high scores by their reward models. This approach, often referred to as the <em>best of N</em> strategy, leverages how a model samples outputs to improve its performance. The next section will shed light on how best of N works<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html42" data-type="indexterm" id="id806"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html41" data-type="indexterm" id="id807"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html40" data-type="indexterm" id="id808"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html39" data-type="indexterm" id="id809"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html38" data-type="indexterm" id="id810"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html33" data-type="indexterm" id="id811"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html32" data-type="indexterm" id="id812"/></p>

<h1>Sampling</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="sampling" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html45"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html46"/>A model constructs its outputs through a process known as <em>sampling</em>. This section discusses different sampling strategies and <em>sampling variables,</em> including temperature, top-k, and top-p. It’ll then explore how to sample multiple outputs to improve a model’s performance. We’ll also see how the sampling process can be modified to get models to generate responses that follow certain formats and constraints.</p>

<p>Sampling makes AI’s outputs probabilistic. Understanding this probabilistic nature is important for handling AI’s behaviors, such as inconsistency and hallucination. This section ends with a deep dive into what this probabilistic nature means and how to work with it.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Sampling Fundamentals"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_sampling_fundamentals_1730147895572293">
<h2>Sampling Fundamentals</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="sampling" data-tertiary="sampling fundamentals" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html47"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="sampling fundamentals" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html48"/>Given an input, a neural network produces an output by first computing the probabilities of possible outcomes. For a classification model, possible outcomes are the available classes. As an example, if a model is trained to classify whether an email is spam or not, there are only two possible outcomes: spam and not spam. The model computes the probability of each of these two outcomes—e.g., the probability of the email being spam is 90%, and not spam is 10%. You can then make decisions based on these output probabilities. For example, if you decide that any email with a spam probability higher than 50% should be marked as spam, an email with a 90% spam probability will be marked as spam.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">For a language model, to generate the next token, the model first computes the probability distribution over all tokens in the vocabulary, which looks like <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_14_1730147895520937">Figure 2-14</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_14_1730147895520937" class="figure"><img alt="A diagram of a color  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0214.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-14. </span>To generate the next token, the language model first computes the probability distribution over all tokens in the vocabulary.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>When working with possible outcomes of different probabilities, a common strategy is to pick the outcome with the highest probability. Always picking the most likely outcome = is called <em>greedy sampling</em>. This often works for classification tasks. For example, if the model thinks that an email is more likely to be spam than not spam, it makes sense to mark it as spam. However, for a language model, greedy sampling creates boring outputs. Imagine a model that, for whatever question you ask, always responds with the most common words.</p>

<p>Instead of always picking the next most likely token, the model can sample the next token according to the probability distribution over all possible values. Given the context of “My favorite color is …” as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_14_1730147895520937">Figure 2-14</a>, if “red” has a 30% chance of being the next token and “green” has a 50% chance, “red” will be picked 30% of the time, and “green” 50% of the time.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="logit vectors" data-type="indexterm" id="id813"/>How does a model compute these probabilities? Given an input, a neural network outputs a logit vector. Each <em>logit</em> corresponds to one possible value. In the case of a language model, each logit corresponds to one token in the model’s vocabulary. The logit vector size is the size of the vocabulary. A visualization of the logits vector is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_15_1730147895520946">Figure 2-15</a>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-15. </span>For each input, a language model produces a logit vector. Each logit corresponds to a token in the vocabulary.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>While larger logits correspond to higher probabilities, logits don’t represent probabilities. Logits don’t sum up to one. Logits can even be negative, while probabilities have to be non-negative. To convert logits to probabilities, a softmax layer is often used. Let’s say the model has a vocabulary of N and the logit vector is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="left-bracket x 1 comma x 2 comma period period period comma x Subscript upper N Baseline right-bracket">

<h2>Sampling Strategies</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="sampling" data-tertiary="sampling strategies" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html49"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="sampling strategies" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html50"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="strategies" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html51"/>The right sampling strategy can make a model generate responses more suitable for your application. For example, one sampling strategy can make the model generate more creative responses, whereas another strategy can make its generations more predictable. Many different sample strategies have been introduced to nudge models toward responses with specific attributes. You can also design your own sampling strategy, though this typically requires access to the model’s logits. Let’s go over a few common sampling strategies to see how they work.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Temperature"><div class="sect3" id="ch02_temperature_1730147895572345">
<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="strategies" data-tertiary="temperature" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html52"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="temperature" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html53"/>One problem with sampling the next token according to the probability distribution is that the model can be less creative. In the previous example, common colors like “red”, “green”, “purple”, and so on have the highest probabilities. The language model’s answer ends up sounding like that of a five-year-old: “My favorite color is green”. Because “the” has a low probability, the model has a low chance of generating a creative sentence such as “My favorite color is the color of a still lake on a spring <span class="keep-together">morning”.</span></p>

<p>To redistribute the probabilities of the possible values, you can sample with a <em>temperature</em>. Intuitively, a higher temperature reduces the probabilities of common tokens, and as a result, increases the probabilities of rarer tokens. This enables models to create more creative responses.</p>

<p>Temperature is a constant used to adjust the logits before the softmax transformation. Logits are divided by temperature. For a given temperature <em>T</em>, the adjusted logit for the <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> token is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="StartFraction x Subscript i Baseline Over upper T EndFraction">
  <mfrac><msub><mi>x</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mi>T</mi></mfrac>
</math>. Softmax is then applied on this adjusted logit instead of on <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="x Subscript i">
  <msub><mi>x</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
</math>.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through a simple example to examine the effect of temperature on probabilities. Imagine that we have a model that has only two possible outputs: A and B. The logits computed from the last layer are [1, 2]. The logit for A is 1 and B is 2.</p>

<p>Without using temperature, which is equivalent to using the temperature of 1, the softmax probabilities are [0.27, 0.73]. The model picks B 73% of the time.</p>

<p>With temperature = 0.5, the probabilities are [0.12, 0.88]. The model now picks B 88% of the time.</p>

<p>The higher the temperature, the less likely it is that the model is going to pick the most obvious value (the value with the highest logit), making the model’s outputs more creative but potentially less coherent. The lower the temperature, the more likely it is that the model is going to pick the most obvious value, making the model’s output more consistent but potentially more boring.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id816-marker" href="ch02.html#id816">24</a></sup></p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_16_1730147895520958">Figure 2-16</a> shows the softmax probabilities for tokens A and B at different temperatures. As the temperature gets closer to 0, the probability that the model picks token B becomes closer to 1. In our example, for a temperature below 0.1, the model almost always outputs B. As the temperature increases, the probability that token A is picked increases while the probability that token B is picked decreases. Model providers typically limit the temperature to be between 0 and 2. If you own your model, you can use any non-negative temperature. A temperature of 0.7 is often recommended for creative use cases, as it balances creativity and predictability, but you should experiment and find the temperature that works best for you.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-16. </span>The softmax probabilities for tokens A and B at different temperatures, given their logits being [1, 2]. Without setting the temperature value, which is equivalent to using the temperature of 1, the softmax probability of B would be 73%.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>It’s common practice to set the temperature to 0 for the model’s outputs to be more consistent. Technically, temperature can never be 0—logits can’t be divided by 0. In practice, when we set the temperature to 0, the model just picks the token with the largest logit,<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id817-marker" href="ch02.html#id817">25</a></sup> without doing logit adjustment and softmax calculation.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>A common debugging technique when working with an AI model is to look at the probabilities this model computes for given inputs. For example, if the probabilities look random, the model hasn’t learned much.</p>
</div>

<p class="pagebreak-before"><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="logprobs" data-type="indexterm" id="id818"/>Many model providers return probabilities generated by their models as <a href="https://oreil.ly/VAUl6">logprobs</a>. <em>Logprobs</em>, short for <em>log probabilities</em>, are probabilities in the log scale. Log scale is preferred when working with a neural network’s probabilities because it helps reduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow">underflow</a> problem.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id819-marker" href="ch02.html#id819">26</a></sup> A language model might be working with a vocabulary size of 100,000, which means the probabilities for many of the tokens can be too small to be represented by a machine. The small numbers might be rounded down to 0. Log scale helps reduce this problem.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_17_1730147895520965">Figure 2-17</a> shows the workflow of how logits, probabilities, and logprobs are <span class="keep-together">computed.</span></p>

<p>As you’ll see throughout the book, logprobs are useful for building applications (especially for classification), evaluating applications, and understanding how models work under the hood. However, as of this writing, many model providers don’t expose their models’ logprobs, or if they do, the logprobs API is limited.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id820-marker" href="ch02.html#id820">27</a></sup> The limited logprobs API is likely due to security reasons as a model’s exposed logprobs make it easier for others to replicate the model.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html53" data-type="indexterm" id="id821"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html52" data-type="indexterm" id="id822"/></p>

Recall that a softmax layer is used to compute the probability distribution over all possible values. Softmax requires two passes over all possible values: one to perform the exponential sum <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="sigma-summation Underscript j Endscripts e Superscript x Super Subscript j">

</math> for each value. For a language model with a large vocabulary, this process is computationally expensive.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, after the model has computed the logits, we pick the top-k logits and perform softmax over these top-k logits only. Depending on how diverse you want your application to be, k can be anywhere from 50 to 500—much smaller than a model’s vocabulary size. The model then samples from these top values. A smaller k value makes the text more predictable but less interesting, as the model is limited to a smaller set of likely words.</p>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="strategies" data-tertiary="top-p" data-type="indexterm" id="id825"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="top-p" data-type="indexterm" id="id826"/>In top-k sampling, the number of values considered is fixed to k. However, this number should change depending on the situation. For example, given the prompt “Do you like music? Answer with only yes or no.” the number of values considered should be two: yes and no. Given the prompt “What’s the meaning of life?” the number of values considered should be much larger.</p>

<p><em>Top-p</em>, also known as <em>nucleus sampling</em>, allows for a more dynamic selection of values to be sampled from. In top-p sampling, the model sums the probabilities of the most likely next values in descending order and stops when the sum reaches p. Only the values within this cumulative probability are considered. Common values for top-p (nucleus) sampling in language models typically range from 0.9 to 0.95. A top-p value of 0.9, for example, means that the model will consider the smallest set of values whose cumulative probability exceeds 90%.</p>

<p>Let’s say the probabilities of all tokens are as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_18_1730147895520971">Figure 2-18</a>. If top-p is 90%, only “yes” and “maybe” will be considered, as their cumulative probability is greater than 90%. If top-p is 99%, then “yes”, “maybe”, and “no” are considered.</p>

<p>Unlike top-k, top-p doesn’t necessarily reduce the softmax computation load. Its benefit is that because it focuses only on the set of most relevant values for each context, it allows outputs to be more contextually appropriate. In theory, there don’t seem to be a lot of benefits to top-p sampling. However, in practice, top-p sampling has proven to work well, causing its popularity to rise.</p>

<p>A related sampling strategy is <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27670">min-p</a>, where you set the minimum probability that a token must reach to be considered during sampling.</p>

<h3>Stopping condition</h3>

A long output sequence takes more time, costs more compute (money),<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id829-marker" href="ch02.html#id829">28</a></sup> and can sometimes annoy users. We might want to set a condition for the model to stop the sequence.</p>

<p>One easy method is to ask models to stop generating after a fixed number of tokens. The downside is that the output is likely to be cut off mid-sentence. Another method is to use <em>stop tokens</em> or <em>stop words</em>. For example, you can ask a model to stop generating when it encounters the end-of-sequence token. Stopping conditions are helpful to keep latency and costs down.</p>

<p>The downside of early stopping is that if you want models to generate outputs in a certain format, premature stopping can cause outputs to be malformatted. For example, if you ask the model to generate JSON, early stopping can cause the output JSON to be missing things like closing brackets, making the generated JSON hard to parse.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html51" data-type="indexterm" id="id830"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html50" data-type="indexterm" id="id831"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html49" data-type="indexterm" id="id832"/></p>

<h2 class="less_space">Test Time Compute</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models" data-secondary="sampling" data-tertiary="test time compute" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html54"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sampling" data-secondary="test time compute" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html55"/>The last section discussed how a model might sample the next token. This section discusses how a model might sample the whole output.</p>

<p>One simple way to improve a model’s response quality is <em>test time compute</em>: instead of generating only one response per query, you generate multiple responses to increase the chance of good responses. One way to do test time compute is the best of N technique discussed earlier in this chapter—you randomly generate multiple outputs and pick one that works best. However, you can also be more strategic about how to generate multiple outputs. For example, instead of generating all outputs independently, which might include many less promising candidates, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search">beam search</a> to generate a fixed number of most promising candidates (the beam) at each step of sequence generation.</p>

<p>A simple strategy to increase the effectiveness of test time compute is to increase the diversity of the outputs, because a more diverse set of options is more likely to yield better candidates. If you use the same model to generate different options, it’s often a good practice to vary the model’s sampling variables to diversify its outputs.</p>

<p>Although you can usually expect some model performance improvement by sampling multiple outputs, it’s expensive. On average, generating two outputs costs approximately twice as much as generating one.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id833-marker" href="ch02.html#id833">29</a></sup></p>

<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>I use the term <em>test time compute</em> to be consistent with the existing literature, even though several early reviewers protested that this term is confusing. In AI research, test time is typically used to refer to inference because researchers mostly only do inference to test a model. However, this technique can be applied to models in production in general. It’s test time compute because the number of outputs you can sample is determined by how much compute you can allocate to each inference call.</p>
</div>

<p>To pick the best output, you can either show users multiple outputs and let them choose the one that works best for them, or you can devise a method to select the best one. One selection method is to pick the output with the highest probability. A language model’s output is a sequence of tokens, and each token has a probability computed by the model. The probability of an output is the product of the probabilities of all tokens in the output.</p>

<p>Consider the sequence of tokens [“I”, “love”, “food”]. If the probability for “I” is 0.2, the probability for “love” given “I” is 0.1, and the probability for “food” given “I” and “love” is 0.3, the sequence’s probability is: <code>0.2 × 0.1 × 0.3 = 0.006</code>. Mathematically, this can be denoted as follows:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">p(I love food) = p(I) × p(I | love) × p(food | I, love)</pre>

<p>Remember that it’s easier to work with probabilities on a log scale. The logarithm of a product is equal to a sum of logarithms, so the logprob of a sequence of tokens is the sum of the logprob of all tokens in the sequence:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">logprob(<em>I love food</em>) = logprob(<em>I</em>) + logprob(<em>I</em> | <em>love</em>) + logprob(<em>food</em> | <em>I, love</em>)</pre>

<p>With summing, longer sequences are likely to have a lower total logprob (logprob values are usually negative, because log of values between 0 and 1 is negative). To avoid biasing toward short sequences, you can use the average logprob by dividing the sum of a sequence by its length. After sampling multiple outputs, you pick the one with the highest average logprob. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="test time compute" id="id834"/>As of this writing, this is what the OpenAI API uses.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id835-marker" href="ch02.html#id835">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Another selection method is to use a reward model to score each output, as discussed in the previous section. Recall that both <a href="https://oreil.ly/1Njeh">Stitch Fix</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/l21nr">Grab</a> pick the outputs given high scores by their reward models or verifiers. <a href="https://oreil.ly/-HQIB">Nextdoor</a> found that using a reward model was the key factor in improving their application’s performance (2023).</p>

<p>OpenAI also trained verifiers to help their models pick the best solutions to math problems (<a href="https://oreil.ly/R_uvq">Cobbe et al., 2021</a>). They found that using a verifier significantly boosted the model performance. <em>In fact, the use of verifiers resulted in approximately the same performance boost as a 30× model size increase.</em> This means that a 100-million-parameter model that uses a verifier can perform on par with a 3-billion-parameter model that doesn’t use a verifier.</p>

<p>DeepMind further proves the value of test time compute, arguing that scaling test time compute (e.g., allocating more compute to generate more outputs during inference) can be more efficient than scaling model parameters (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314">Snell et al., 2024</a>). The same paper asks an interesting question: If an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but nontrivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">In OpenAI’s experiment, sampling more outputs led to better performance, but only up to a certain point. In this experiment, that point was 400 outputs. Beyond this point, performance decreases, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_19_1730147895520976">Figure 2-19</a>. They hypothesized that as the number of sampled outputs increases, the chance of finding adversarial outputs that can fool the verifier also increases. However, a Stanford experiment showed a different conclusion. “Monkey Business” (<a href="https://oreil.ly/8YNwQ">Brown et al., 2024</a>) finds that the number of problems solved often increases log-linearly as the number of samples increases from 1 to 10,000. While it’s interesting to think about whether test time compute can be scaled indefinitely, I don’t believe anyone in production samples 400 or 10,000 different outputs for each input. The cost would be <span class="keep-together">astronomical.</span></p>

</div></figure>

<p>You can also use application-specific heuristics to select the best response. For example, if your application benefits from shorter responses, you can pick the shortest candidate. If your application converts natural language to SQL queries, you can get the model to keep on generating outputs until it generates a valid SQL query.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">One particularly interesting application of test time compute is to overcome the latency challenge. For some queries, especially chain-of-thought queries, a model might take a long time to complete the response. Kittipat Kampa, head of AI at TIFIN, told me that his team asks their model to generate multiple responses in parallel and show the user the first response that is completed and valid.</p>

<p>Picking out the most common output among a set of outputs can be especially useful for tasks that expect exact answers.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id836-marker" href="ch02.html#id836">31</a></sup> For example, given a math problem, the model can solve it multiple times and pick the most frequent answer as its final solution. Similarly, for a multiple-choice question, a model can pick the most frequent output option. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Gemini" id="id837"/>This is what Google did when evaluating Gemini on the MMLU benchmark. They sampled 32 outputs for each question. This allowed the model to achieve a higher score than what it would’ve achieved with only one output per question.</p>

<p>A model is considered robust if it doesn’t dramatically change its outputs with small variations in the input. The less robust a model is, the more you can benefit from sampling multiple outputs.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id838-marker" href="ch02.html#id838">32</a></sup> For one project, we used AI to extract certain information from an image of the product. We found that for the same image, our model could read the information only half of the time. For the other half, the model said that the image was too blurry or the text was too small to read. However, by trying three times with each image, the model was able to extract the correct information for most images.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html55" data-type="indexterm" id="id839"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html54" data-type="indexterm" id="id840"/></p>

<h2>Structured Outputs</h2>

Structured outputs are crucial for the following two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><em>Tasks requiring structured outputs.</em> The most common category of tasks in this scenario is semantic parsing. Semantic parsing involves converting natural language into a structured, machine-readable format. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="text-to-SQL" id="id841"/>Text-to-SQL is an example of semantic parsing, where the outputs must be valid SQL queries. Semantic parsing allow users to interact with APIs using a natural language (e.g., English). For example, text-to-PostgreSQL allows users to query a Postgres database using English queries such as “What’s the average monthly revenue over the last 6 months” instead of writing it in PostgreSQL.</p>

	<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">This is an example of a prompt for GPT-4o to do text-to-regex. The outputs are actual outputs generated by GPT-4o:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>System prompt</strong>
Given an item, create a regex that represents all the ways the item can be 
written. Return only the regex.

Example:
US phone number -&gt; \+?1?\s?(\()?(\d{3})(?(1)\))[-.\s]?(\d{3})[-.\s]?(\d{4})

<strong>User prompt</strong>
Email address -&gt;

<strong>GPT-4o</strong>

<strong>User prompt</strong>
Dates -&gt;

<strong>GTP-4o</strong>
(?:\d{1,2}[\/\-\.])(?:\d{1,2}[\/\-\.])?\d{2,4}
	</pre>

	<p>Other categories of tasks in this scenario include classification where the outputs have to be valid classes.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><p><em>Tasks whose outputs are used by downstream applications.</em> In this scenario, the task itself doesn’t need the outputs to be structured, but because the outputs are used by other applications, they need to be parsable by these applications.</p>

	<p>For example, if you use an AI model to write an email, the email itself doesn’t have to be structured. However, a downstream application using this email might need it to be in a specific format—for example, a JSON document with specific keys, such as <code>{"title": [TITLE], "body": [EMAIL BODY]}</code>.</p>

	<p><em>This is especially important for agentic workflows</em> where a model’s outputs are often passed as inputs into tools that the model can use, as discussed in <span class="keep-together"><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">Chapter 6</a></span>.</p>

Each model provider might also use their own techniques to improve their models’ ability to generate structured outputs. OpenAI was the first model provider to introduce <a href="https://oreil.ly/NxZDF"><em>JSON mode</em></a> in their text generation API. Note that an API’s JSON mode typically guarantees only that the outputs are valid JSON—not the content of the JSON objects. The otherwise valid generated JSONs can also be truncated, and thus not parsable, if the generation stops too soon, such as when it reaches the maximum output token length. However, if the max token length is set too long, the model’s responses become both too slow and expensive.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_20_1730147895520984">Figure 2-20</a> shows two examples of using guidance to generate outputs constrained to a set of options and a regex.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>You can guide a model to generate structured outputs at different layers of the AI stack: prompting, post-processing, test time compute, constrained sampling, and finetuning. The first three are more like bandages. They work best if the model is already pretty good at generating structured outputs and just needs a little nudge. For intensive treatment, you need constrained sampling and finetuning.</p>

<p>Test time compute has just been discussed in the previous section—keep on generating outputs until one fits the expected format. This section focuses on the other four approaches.</p>

You can instruct a model to generate outputs in any format. However, whether a model can follow this instruction depends on the model’s instruction-following capability (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_evaluate_ai_systems_1730130866187863">Chapter 4</a>), and the clarity of the instruction (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a>). While models are getting increasingly good at following instructions, there’s no guarantee that they’ll always follow your instructions.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id844-marker" href="ch02.html#id844">33</a></sup> A few percentage points of invalid model outputs can still be unacceptable for many applications.</p>

<p>To increase the percentage of valid outputs, some people use AI to validate and/or correct the output of the original prompt. This is an example of the AI as a judge approach discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a>. This means that for each output, there will be at least two model queries: one to generate the output and one to validate it. While the added validation layer can significantly improve the validity of the outputs, the extra cost and latency incurred by the extra validation queries can make this approach too expensive for some.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Post-processing"><div class="sect3" id="ch02_post_processing_1730147895572520">
<h3>Post-processing</h3>

<p>Post-processing is simple and cheap but can work surprisingly well. During my time teaching, I noticed that students tended to make very similar mistakes. When I started working with foundation models, I noticed the same thing. A model tends to repeat similar mistakes across queries. This means if you find the common mistakes <span class="keep-together">a model</span> makes, you can potentially write a script to correct them. For example, if the generated JSON object misses a closing bracket, manually add that bracket. <span class="keep-together">LinkedIn’s</span> defensive YAML parser increased the percentage of correct YAML outputs from 90% to 99.99% (<a href="https://oreil.ly/ZTRaA">Bottaro and Ramgopal, 2020</a>).</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>JSON and YAML are common text formats. LinkedIn found that their underlying model, GPT-4, worked with both, but they chose YAML as their output format because it is less verbose, and hence requires fewer output tokens than JSON (Bottaro and Ramgopal, 2020).</p>
</div>

<p>Post-processing works only if the mistakes are easy to fix. This usually happens if a model’s outputs are already mostly correctly formatted, with occasional small errors.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Constrained sampling"><div class="sect3" id="ch02_constrained_sampling_1730147895572544">
<h3>Constrained sampling</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="constrained sampling" data-type="indexterm" id="id845"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="structured outputs" data-secondary="constrained sampling" data-type="indexterm" id="id846"/><em>Constraint sampling</em> is a technique for guiding the generation of text toward certain constraints. It is typically followed by structured output tools.</p>

<p>At a high level, to generate a token, the model samples among values that meet the constraints. Recall that to generate a token, your model first outputs a logit vector, each logit corresponding to one possible token. Constrained sampling filters this logit vector to keep only the tokens that meet the constraints. It then samples from these valid tokens. This process is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_21_1730147895520993">Figure 2-21</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_21_1730147895520993" class="figure"><img alt="A diagram of a software model  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0221.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-21. </span>Filter out logits that don’t meet the constraints in order to sample only among valid outputs.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>In the example in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_21_1730147895520993">Figure 2-21</a>, the constraint is straightforward to filter for. However, most cases aren’t that straightforward. You need to have a grammar that specifies what is and isn’t allowed at each step. For example, JSON grammar dictates that after <code>{</code>, you can’t have another <code>{</code> unless it’s part of a string, as in <code>{"key": "{{string}}"}</code>.</p>

<p>Building out that grammar and incorporating it into the sampling process is nontrivial. Because each output format—JSON, YAML, regex, CSV, and so on—needs its own grammar, constraint sampling is less generalizable. Its use is limited to the formats whose grammars are supported by external tools or by your team. Grammar verification can also increase generation latency (<a href="https://oreil.ly/hNRf4">Brandon T. Willard, 2024</a>).</p>

<p>Some are against constrained sampling because they believe the resources needed for constrained sampling are better invested in training models to become better at following instructions.</p>

<p>For certain tasks, you can guarantee the output format by modifying the model’s architecture before finetuning.

Let’s go over an example to see what being probabilistic means. Imagine that you want to know what’s the best cuisine in the world. If you ask your friend this question twice, a minute apart, your friend’s answers both times should be the same. If you ask an AI model the same question twice, its answer can change. If an AI model thinks that Vietnamese cuisine has a 70% chance of being the best cuisine in the world and Italian cuisine has a 30% chance, it’ll answer “Vietnamese cuisine” 70% of the time and “Italian cuisine” 30% of the time. The opposite of probabilistic is <em>deterministic</em>, when the outcome can be determined without any random variation.</p>

<p>This probabilistic nature can cause inconsistency and hallucinations. <em>Inconsistency</em> is when a model generates very different responses for the same or slightly different prompts. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hallucinations" data-secondary="defined" id="id856"/><em>Hallucination</em> is when a model gives a response that isn’t grounded in facts. Imagine if someone on the internet wrote an essay about how all US presidents are aliens, and this essay was included in the training data. The model later will probabilistically output that the current US president is an alien. From the perspective of someone who doesn’t believe that US presidents are aliens, the model is making this up.</p>

<p>Foundation models are usually trained using a large amount of data. They are aggregations of the opinions of the masses, containing within them, literally, a world of possibilities. Anything with a non-zero probability, no matter how far-fetched or wrong, can be generated by AI.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id857-marker" href="ch02.html#id857">36</a></sup></p>

<p>This characteristic makes building AI applications both exciting and challenging. Many of the AI engineering efforts, as we’ll see in this book, aim to harness and mitigate this probabilistic nature.</p>

<p>This probabilistic nature makes AI great for creative tasks. What is creativity but the ability to explore beyond the common paths—to think outside the box? AI is a great sidekick for creative professionals. It can brainstorm limitless ideas and generate never-before-seen designs. However, this same probabilistic nature can be a pain for everything else.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id858-marker" href="ch02.html#id858">37</a></sup></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Same input, different outputs: Giving the model the same prompt twice leads to two very different responses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Slightly different input, drastically different outputs: Giving the model a slightly different prompt, such as accidentally capitalizing a letter, can lead to a very different output.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_23_1730147895521014">Figure 2-23</a> shows an example of me trying to use ChatGPT to score essays. The same prompt gave me two different scores when I ran it twice: 3/5 and 5/5.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-23. </span>The same input can produce different outputs in the same model.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Inconsistency can create a jarring user experience. In human-to-human communication, we expect a certain level of consistency. Imagine a person giving you a different name every time you see them. Similarly, users expect a certain level of consistency when communicating with AI.</p>

<p>For the same input, different outputs scenario, there are multiple approaches to mitigate inconsistency. You can cache the answer so that the next time the same question is asked, the same answer is returned. You can fix the model’s sampling variables, such as temperature, top-p, and top-k values, as discussed earlier. You can also fix the <em>seed</em> variable, which you can think of as the starting point for the random number generator used for sampling the next token.</p>

<p>Even if you fix all these variables, however, there’s no guarantee that your model will be consistent 100% of the time. The hardware the model runs the output generation on can also impact the output, as different machines have different ways of executing the same instruction and can handle different ranges of numbers. If you host your models, you have some control over the hardware you use. However, if you use a model API provider like OpenAI or Google, it’s up to these providers to give you any control.</p>

<p>Fixing the output generation settings is a good practice, but it doesn’t inspire trust in the system. Imagine a teacher who gives you consistent scores only if that teacher sits in one particular room. If that teacher sits in a different room, that teacher’s scores for you will be wild.</p>

<p>The second scenario—slightly different input, drastically different outputs—is more challenging. Fixing the model’s output generation variables is still a good practice, but it won’t force the model to generate the same outputs for different inputs. It is, however, possible to get models to generate responses closer to what you want with carefully crafted prompts (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a>) and a memory system (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">Chapter 6</a>).<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html64" data-type="indexterm" id="id859"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html63" data-type="indexterm" id="id860"/></p>

<h3>Hallucination</h3>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hallucinations" data-secondary="causes of" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html65"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="probabilistic nature of AI" data-secondary="hallucination" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html66"/>Hallucinations are fatal for tasks that depend on factuality. If you’re asking AI to help you explain the pros and cons of a vaccine, you don’t want AI to be pseudo-scientific. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="hallucinations" id="id861"/>In June 2023, a law firm was<a href="https://oreil.ly/FCyyA"> fined for submitting fictitious legal research to court</a>. They had used ChatGPT to prepare their case, unaware of ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate.</p>

<p>While hallucination became a prominent issue with the rise of LLMs, hallucination was a common phenomenon for generative models even before the term foundation model and the transformer architecture were introduced. Hallucination in the context of text generation was mentioned as early as 2016 (<a href="https://oreil.ly/cg0JY">Goyal et al., 2016</a>). Detecting and measuring hallucinations has been a staple in natural language generation (NLG) since then (see <a href="https://oreil.ly/ah9MT">Lee et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://oreil.ly/13wUD">Nie et al., 2019</a>; and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02593">Zhou et al., 2020</a>). This section focuses on explaining why hallucinations happen. How to detect and measure evaluation is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_evaluate_ai_systems_1730130866187863">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p>If inconsistency arises from randomness in the sampling process, the cause of hallucination is more nuanced. The sampling process alone doesn’t sufficiently explain it. A model samples outputs from all probable options. But how does something never seen before become a probable option? A model can output something that is believed to have never been seen before in the training data. We can’t say this for sure because it’s impossible to comb through the training data to verify whether it contains an idea. Our ability to construct something so complex that we can no longer understand it is both a blessing and a curse.</p>

<p>It’s hard to devise a way to eliminate hallucinations without understanding why hallucinations occur in the first place. There are currently two hypotheses about why language models hallucinate.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis, originally expressed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10819#deepmind">Ortega et al. at DeepMind in 2021</a>, is that a language model hallucinates because it can’t differentiate between the data it’s given and the data it generates. Let’s go through an example to illustrate this.</p>

<p>Imagine that you give the model the prompt: “Who’s Chip Huyen?” and the first sentence the model generates is: “Chip Huyen is an architect.” The next token the model generates will be conditioned on the sequence: “Who’s Chip Huyen? Chip Huyen is an architect.” The model treats “Chip Huyen is an architect.”, something it produced, the same way it treats a given fact. Starting with a generated sequence slightly out of the ordinary, the model can expand upon it and generate outrageously wrong facts. Ortega and the other authors called hallucinations a form of <em>self-delusion</em>.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_24_1730147895521021">Figure 2-24</a> shows an example of self-delusion by the model LLaVA-v1.5-7B. I asked the model to identify ingredients listed on the product’s label in the image, which is a bottle of shampoo. In its response, the model convinces itself that the product in the image is a bottle of milk, then continues to include milk in the list of ingredients extracted from the product’s label.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-24. </span>An example of self-delusion by LLaVA-v1.5-7B.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Zhang et al. (2023) call this phenomenon <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13534">snowballing hallucinations</a>. After making an incorrect assumption, a model can continue hallucinating to justify the initial wrong assumption. Interestingly, the authors show that initial wrong assumptions can cause the model to make mistakes on questions it would otherwise be able to answer correctly, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_25_1730147895521031">Figure 2-25</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_25_1730147895521031" class="figure"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0225.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-25. </span>An initial incorrect assumption can cause the model to claim that 9677 is divisible by 13, even if it knows this isn’t true.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The DeepMind paper showed that hallucinations can be mitigated by two techniques. The first technique comes from reinforcement learning, in which the model is made to differentiate between user-provided prompts (called <em>observations about the world</em> in reinforcement learning) and tokens generated by the model (called the model’s <em>actions</em>). The second technique leans on supervised learning, in which factual and counterfactual signals are included in the training data.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis is that hallucination is caused by the mismatch between the model’s internal knowledge and the labeler’s internal knowledge. This view was first argued by <a href="https://oreil.ly/9idN4">Leo Gao</a>, an OpenAI researcher. During SFT, models are trained to mimic responses written by labelers. If these responses use the knowledge that the labelers have but the model doesn’t have, we’re effectively teaching the model to hallucinate. In theory, if labelers can include the knowledge they use with each response they write so that the model knows that the responses aren’t made up, we can perhaps teach the model to use only what it knows. However, this is impossible in practice.</p>

<p>In April 2023, John Schulman, an OpenAI co-founder, expressed the same view in his <a href="https://oreil.ly/Fqo2S">UC Berkeley talk</a>. Schulman also believes that LLMs know if they know something, which, in itself, is a big claim. If this belief is true, hallucinations can be fixed by forcing a model to give answers based on only the information it knows. He proposed two solutions. One is verification: for each response, ask the model to retrieve the sources it bases this response on. Another is to use reinforcement learning. Remember that the reward model is trained using only comparisons—response A is better than response B—without an explanation of why A is better. Schulman argued that a better reward function that punishes a model more for making things up can help mitigate <span class="keep-together">hallucinations.</span></p>

<p>In that same talk, Schulman mentioned that OpenAI found that RLHF helps with reducing hallucinations. However, the InstructGPT paper shows that RLHF made hallucination worse, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_26_1730147895521041">Figure 2-26</a>. Even though RLHF seemed to worsen hallucinations for InstructGPT, it improved other aspects, and overall, human labelers prefer the RLHF model over the SFT alone model.</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_26_1730147895521041" class="figure"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aien_0226.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-26. </span>Hallucination is worse for the model that uses both RLHF and SFT (InstructGPT) compared to the same model that uses only SFT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">Ouyang et al., 2022</a>).</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Based on the assumption that a foundation model knows what it knows, some people try to reduce hallucination with prompts, such as adding “Answer as truthfully as possible, and if you’re unsure of the answer, say, ‘Sorry, I don’t know.’” Asking <span class="keep-together">models</span> for concise responses also seems to help with hallucinations—the fewer tokens a model has to generate, the less chance it has to make things up. Prompting and context construction techniques in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">5</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">6</a> can also help mitigate <span class="keep-together">hallucinations.</span></p>

<p>The two hypotheses discussed complement each other. The self-delusion hypothesis focuses on how self-supervision causes hallucinations, whereas the mismatched internal knowledge hypothesis focuses on how supervision causes hallucinations.</p>

<p>If we can’t stop hallucinations altogether, can we at least detect when a model hallucinates so that we won’t serve those hallucinated responses to users? Well, detecting hallucinations isn’t that straightforward either—think about how hard it is for us to detect when another human is lying or making things up. But people have tried. We discuss how to detect and measure hallucinations in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html66" data-type="indexterm" id="id862"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html65" data-type="indexterm" id="id863"/><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_evaluate_ai_systems_1730130866187863">Chapter 4</a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html62" data-type="indexterm" id="id864"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html61" data-type="indexterm" id="id865"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html60" data-type="indexterm" id="id866"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html59" data-type="indexterm" id="id867"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html46" data-type="indexterm" id="id868"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html45" data-type="indexterm" id="id869"/></p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>This chapter discussed the core design decisions when building a foundation model. Since most people will be using ready-made foundation models instead of training one from scratch, I skipped the nitty-gritty training details in favor of modeling factors that help you determine what models to use and how to use them.</p>

<p>A crucial factor affecting a model’s performance is its training data. Large models require a large amount of training data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Model providers, therefore, often leverage whatever data is available. This leads to models that can perform well on the many tasks present in the training data, which may not include the specific task you want. This chapter went over why it’s often necessary to curate training data to develop models targeting specific languages, especially low-resource languages, and specific domains.</p>

<p>After sourcing the data, model development can begin. While model training often dominates the headlines, an important step prior to that is architecting the model. The chapter looked into modeling choices, such as model architecture and model size. The dominating architecture for language-based foundation models is transformer. This chapter explored the problems that the transformer architecture was designed to address, as well as its limitations.</p>

<p>The scale of a model can be measured by three key numbers: the number of parameters, the number of training tokens, and the number of FLOPs needed for training. Two aspects that influence the amount of compute needed to train a model are the model size and the data size. The scaling law helps determine the optimal number of parameters and number of tokens given a compute budget. This chapter also looked at scaling bottlenecks. Currently, scaling up a model generally makes it better. But how long will this continue to be true?</p>

<p>Due to the low quality of training data and self-supervision during pre-training, the resulting model might produce outputs that don’t align with what users want. This is addressed by post-training, which consists of two steps: supervised finetuning and preference finetuning. Human preference is diverse and impossible to capture in a single mathematical formula, so existing solutions are far from foolproof.</p>

<p>This chapter also covered one of my favorite topics: sampling, the process by which a model generates output tokens. Sampling makes AI models probabilistic. This probabilistic nature is what makes models like ChatGPT and Gemini great for creative tasks and fun to talk to. However, this probabilistic nature also causes inconsistency and hallucinations.</p>

<p>Working with AI models requires building your workflows around their probabilistic nature. The rest of this book will explore how to make AI engineering, if not deterministic, at least systematic. The first step toward systematic AI engineering is to establish a solid evaluation pipeline to help detect failures and unexpected changes. Evaluation for foundation models is so crucial that I dedicated two chapters to it, starting with the next chapter.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html0" data-type="indexterm" id="id870"/></p>

For example, if you want to evaluate the risk of people using AI to spread misinformation, you might want to try to build a model that’s as good at making up fake news as possible, to see how convincing AI can be.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id816"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id816-marker">24</a></sup> A visual image I have in mind when thinking about temperature, which isn’t entirely scientific, is that a higher temperature causes the probability distribution to be more chaotic, which enables lower-probability tokens to surface.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id817"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id817-marker">25</a></sup> Performing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arg_max">arg max function</a>.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id819"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id819-marker">26</a></sup> The underflow problem occurs when a number is too small to be represented in a given format, leading to it being rounded down to zero.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id820"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id820-marker">27</a></sup> To be more specific, as of this writing, OpenAI API only shows you the <a href="https://oreil.ly/jWEsP">logprobs</a> of up to the 20 most likely tokens. It used to let you get the logprobs of arbitrary user-provided text but discontinued this in <a href="https://x.com/xuanalogue/status/1707757449900437984">September 2023</a>. Anthropic doesn’t expose its models’ logprobs.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id829"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id829-marker">28</a></sup> Paid model APIs often charge per number of output tokens.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id833"><sup><a href="ch02.html#id833-marker">29</a></sup> There are things you can do to reduce the cost of generating multiple outputs for the same input.

In a panel I participated in with Drew Houston (CEO of Dropbox) and Harrison Chase (CEO of LangChain) in July 2023, we all agreed that hallucination is the biggest blocker for many AI enterprise use cases.</p></div></div>
