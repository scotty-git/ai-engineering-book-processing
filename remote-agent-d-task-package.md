## 5-Phase Methodology (Apply to Each Micro-Task)

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
1. Extract exact lines from full-book-messy.md for range 3301-3997
2. Validate extraction completeness
3. Create working reference for your sections

### Phase 2: Text Cleaning
1. Remove page numbers and PDF artifacts
2. Fix broken hyphens and technical terms
3. Normalize spacing and paragraph breaks
4. Handle footnote markers and references
5. Preserve code examples and mathematical notation

### Phase 3: Structure Analysis
1. Identify all headings and technical sections
2. Map content types (code, math, research, behaviors)
3. Note special formatting requirements
4. Plan Markdown structure for diverse content

### Phase 4: Markdown Formatting
1. Apply proper heading hierarchy
2. Format diverse content:
   - Code examples with proper blocks
   - Mathematical examples with clear notation
   - Research findings with professional presentation
   - Behavioral analysis with systematic format
3. Handle technical terminology consistently
4. Maintain professional presentation

### Phase 5: Quality Validation
1. Verify code example accuracy
2. Check mathematical notation formatting
3. Validate research finding presentation
4. Ensure behavioral analysis clarity
5. Collect footnotes for final assembly

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Quality standards validation passed
- [ ] Code examples properly formatted in code blocks
- [ ] Mathematical examples clearly presented
- [ ] Research findings and figures referenced correctly
- [ ] Behavioral analysis systematically formatted
- [ ] Summary section comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Footnotes collected and noted for consolidation
- [ ] Output file created: `chapter-02-agent-d-output.md`
- [ ] No user intervention required during processing

## Deliverables
1. **Processed sections** in clean Markdown format
2. **Output file**: chapter-02-agent-d-output.md
3. **Footnote collection** - list of all footnotes found in your sections
4. **Quality validation report** - confirmation of standards compliance
5. **Processing notes** - any code or research issues encountered

## Autonomous Execution Instructions
1. Work through each micro-task systematically
2. Apply the 5-phase methodology to each section
3. Pay special attention to code and mathematical accuracy
4. Use Chapter 1 as your formatting reference
5. Complete all tasks without requesting user confirmation
6. Validate diverse content types at each phase
7. Create final output file with all sections combined
8. Document any technical issues for assembly review

## Quality Reference
Use chapter-01-introduction-to-building-ai-applications-with-foundation-models.md as your formatting template. Match:
- Code example formatting
- Mathematical notation handling
- Research finding presentation
- Summary section format
- Professional technical presentation

## Coordination Notes
- Work independently on your assigned sections only
- Note any cross-references to other agents' sections
- Collect footnotes separately for final consolidation
- Document any formatting decisions for diverse content
- Complete work autonomously without user intervention
