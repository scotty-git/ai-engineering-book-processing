Many companies have sprung up to capitalize on open source models by providing inference and finetuning services. It’s not a bad thing. Many people need these services to leverage open source models. But, from model developers’ perspective, why invest millions, if not billions, into building models just for others to make money?It might be argued that Meta supports open source models only to keep their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in check. Both Mistral and Cohere have open source models, but they also have APIs. At some point, inference services on top of Mistral and Cohere models become their competitors.There’s the argument that open source is better for society, and maybe that’s enough as an incentive.

Many companies have sprung up to capitalize on open source models by providing inference and finetuning services. It’s not a bad thing. Many people need these services to leverage open source models. But, from model developers’ perspective, why invest millions, if not billions, into building models just for others to make money?It might be argued that Meta supports open source models only to keep their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in check.
