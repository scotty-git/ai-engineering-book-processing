## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Autonomous Execution Requirements
- **NO USER CONFIRMATION**: Agents must work from start to finish without asking for permission
- **COMPLETE TASK PACKAGES**: All information needed is provided in task packages
- **MANDATORY COMMIT**: Final step is always committing work to GitHub repo
- **SELF-CONTAINED**: Each agent has everything needed to complete their work

### If Agent Asks for Confirmation
**Response**: 
```
Continue working autonomously. You have all information needed in your task package. 
Complete all remaining tasks and commit your results to GitHub without further confirmation.
```

## üîÑ Post-Processing Workflow

1. **Monitor Agent Progress**: Track completion via GitHub commits
2. **Collect Outputs**: Download all 8 agent output files
3. **Assemble Chapters**: Combine agent outputs in correct order
4. **Consolidate Footnotes**: Merge and renumber footnotes
5. **Quality Review**: Validate against standards
6. **Update UI**: Add chapters to markdown viewer
7. **Document Results**: Update progress tracker

## üìà Success Metrics

- **8/8 Agents Complete**: All agents finish autonomously
- **Quality Standards Met**: Professional formatting and content
- **UI Integration**: Both chapters viewable in web app
- **Timeline Achievement**: Complete within 5.5 hours
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: Fully autonomous execution
