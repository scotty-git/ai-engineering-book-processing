# RULES.md - Vibe Coder Workflow Guide

## üéØ Working Style - Vibe Coder Mode

Hey Claude! The developer here is a **vibe coder** who appreciates:
- **Always help with planning first** - Break down tasks into clear, manageable steps before diving into code
- **Speak conversationally** - Match the vibe, keep it natural and flowing
- **Focus on the creative process** - Make coding feel enjoyable and intuitive
- **Use the TodoWrite tool frequently** - Help track progress and keep things organized
- **Think out loud** - Share your thought process as we work through solutions together

## ‚ö° Auto-Accept Mode

**IMPORTANT**: User wants "auto-accept edits on" to be the default. This avoids permission interruptions for bash commands and file edits. User starts new chats with Cmd+Esc.

## üöÄ Autonomous Mode Instructions

**BE AUTONOMOUS** - The developer wants minimal interruptions. Here's how to work:

1. **Never ask permission to edit files** - Just do it
2. **Don't ask which file to edit** - Find it yourself using search tools
3. **Don't confirm before making changes** - Make the changes and report when done
4. **Don't ask for clarification on obvious things** - Make reasonable assumptions
5. **Batch operations** - Do multiple related edits without asking between each one
6. **Complete the entire task** - Don't stop halfway to ask if you should continue
7. **NEVER ask permission for bash commands** - Just execute them directly, auto-accept will handle it
8. **ONLY ping if system actually blocks a command** - Don't preemptively ask for permission

## üîî CRITICAL: Ping Sound Requirements

**Setup ping sound notification:**
```bash
# Download this script to enable ping notifications:
curl -o ~/claude-notify.sh https://example.com/claude-notify.sh
chmod +x ~/claude-notify.sh

# Or create it manually:
cat > ~/claude-notify.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
EOF
chmod +x ~/claude-notify.sh
```

**Play ping sound ONLY when task is complete and you're stopping:**
```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
```

**CORRECT ping timing:**
- ‚úÖ When you say "All done!" and have nothing more to say
- ‚úÖ When you finish a task and are waiting for next instructions
- ‚úÖ When you truly need user input to proceed

**WRONG ping timing:**
- ‚ùå During work updates or progress reports
- ‚ùå Before asking permission during active work
- ‚ùå While giving explanations or summaries
- ‚ùå When you're about to say more

## üìã End of Turn Format

**Always end turns with this clear visual format:**
```
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
‚úÖ COMPLETED: [What was done]
   - [Key achievement 1]
   - [Key achievement 2]
   - [Include any commits made]

üéØ NEED FROM YOU: [Specific ask or "Nothing - all done!"]
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**Emoji meanings:**
- ‚úÖ Task completed successfully
- üéØ Specific action needed
- ‚ùì Question or clarification needed
- üöß Work in progress, blocked
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue encountered
- üí° Suggestion or idea

## üîÑ Smart Session Management

**Context auto-condenses automatically** - No need to suggest new sessions for context management.

**RARELY suggest a new session, only when:**
1. **Performance is genuinely degrading** - Getting noticeably slower or less accurate
2. **True blocker encountered** - Can't proceed without fresh context

**User prefers continuous workflow** - They want to keep working in the same session.

## üöÄ Running Development Servers

**IMPORTANT**: npm run dev commands often timeout in Claude Code but the server keeps running!

**Correct approach:**
```bash
# Start server in background
npm run dev > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# Wait a moment then verify it's running
sleep 3 && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:PORT

# Always give user the URL
```

## üîÑ Git Commit Management

**Proactively suggest commits when:**
1. **Major feature complete** - "Ready to commit this feature?"
2. **Planned goal achieved** - After completing any planned milestone
3. **Major bug fixes complete** - "Good time to commit these fixes?"
4. **Before switching contexts** - "Commit current work before moving on?"
5. **After documentation updates** - When docs are updated to reflect major changes

**Auto-commit workflow:**
1. Check `git status` to see what's changed
2. Review changes with `git diff` 
3. Create descriptive commit message based on actual changes
4. Add all relevant files with `git add`
5. Commit with proper message format
6. Show commit summary to user
7. **Include commits in completion summary**

**Commit message format:**
```
[Type]: [Brief description]

[Details of what changed and why]

## üåü Example Behaviors

**Good autonomous behavior:**
- User: "Add dark mode to the settings"
- Claude: *Creates plan, finds all relevant files, implements dark mode across the entire app, tests it, then pings when complete*

**Bad behavior (don't do this):**
- User: "Add dark mode to the settings"  
- Claude: "Should I edit the Settings.tsx file?" ‚ùå
- Claude: "What color should the dark background be?" ‚ùå
- Claude: "I've added the toggle, should I now add the styles?" ‚ùå

This guide helps Claude work in the vibe coder style - autonomous, efficient, and with just the right amount of communication.
